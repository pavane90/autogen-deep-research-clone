Proponents see the tech as the key to nuclear energy’s future.![]( 21 July 2025- - Link copied to clipboard![]( core module of China\\\\\\'s Linglong One small modular reactor was installed in August 2023 in Hainan Province. (Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)The nuclear energy industry is seeing  in global interest as governments, utilities, and tech giants seek to meet soaring electricity demand with around-the-clock, carbon-free power.That’s true for not only conventional nuclear power plants but also a\\\\xa0suite of alternative technologies known as \\\\u200b“ ,” or SMRs, which proponents say could deliver nuclear energy at far lower costs and on faster timescales.Broadly defined, SMRs include designs ranging in capacity from 1\\\\xa0megawatt to several hundred megawatts. They encompass reactors using the same light-water technology that’s inside most existing nuclear plants, as well as projects with gas-cooled reactors or that use  like high-assay low-enriched uranium.Seventy-four SMR designs are actively being developed worldwide, according to  from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), an intergovernmental agency within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Of that group, 51 designs are involved in pre-licensing or licensing activities with nuclear safety regulators in 15 countries — including the United States — marking a\\\\xa065% increase in such efforts since 2023. The NEA said this growth reflects significant progress in bringing paper concepts closer to real-world projects, though only two commercial SMRs are actually operating today.There’s \\\\u200b“a real momentum behind this class of technologies,” William D. Magwood IV, the director-general of NEA, told reporters last week ahead of the July 22 launch of the agency’s updated SMR-tracking report.At least $15 billion in public and private financing is now flowing into the SMR space, by the agency’s count.![]( screenshot of NEA\\\\\\'s small modular reactor dashboard shows licensing progress of designs worldwide. (NEA)The idea for small-scale reactors isn’t new: Nuclear scientists have been  for over half a\\\\xa0century, ever since the first fission power plants went critical in the 1950s. Previous attempts to quickly and cheaply build smaller plants have failed, though nuclear advocates say the technology is finally ready to launch — as long as the industry can overcome the high technical and regulatory barriers that ensnared earlier generations.“I’ve seen small reactors come and go over the years,” said Magwood. \\\\u200b“The economics and other issues have always held them back. But what’s really different this time is that the need for [SMRs] is very clearly there.”## **A growing list of hopeful SMR projects**Proponents envision SMRs as a\\\\xa0more nimble alternative to the giant power plants that currently provide  of global electricity today.Large-scale reactors can deliver gigawatts of baseload electricity, but they require a\\\\xa0staggering amount of time and resources to build. In Georgia, Plant Vogtle’s 2.2GW expansion took 15\\\\xa0years and cost  by the time the project was completed in April 2024. The challenging economics — plus the complications of handling radioactive waste and the risk of  — help explain why nuclear power has stagnated over the years and is used in only 31 countries.With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs. The designs being developed today aim to do everything from powering merchant ships and off-grid mining operations to supplying baseload power for data centers and producing high-temperature heat for manufacturing.“SMR is not one thing — it’s a\\\\xa0wide range of sizes, a\\\\xa0wide range of temperatures,” said Diane Cameron, who leads NEA’s division of nuclear technology development and economics.“This is both an opportunity and a\\\\xa0challenge,” she said on the press call. \\\\u200b“There’s a\\\\xa0lot going on, and sometimes financiers or regulators and policymakers are wondering where to focus their efforts first.” That includes figuring out how to handle new types of nuclear-fuel waste streams from cutting-edge SMR designs, in addition to the mounting waste from conventional reactors.![]( Darlington nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. (OPG)So far, however, SMRs have yet to reach their potential.Cameron noted that the only commercial reactors generating electricity today include  at China’s Shidaowan Bay nuclear plant — in which two small units drive a\\\\xa0single 210MW steam turbine — and a\\\\xa070MW  on a\\\\xa0barge in Russia. A\\\\xa0is%20the%20first%20and,%C2%B71/4Cr-1Mo%20)) in Japan is operating inside a\\\\xa0laboratory. Meanwhile, in Argentina, the CAREM-25 reactor has been under construction for over a\\\\xa0decade, though work  due to funding shortfalls.In the U.S., the startup NuScale Power is the only SMR developer to have its  by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, though plans to build a\\\\xa077MW unit in Idaho  after NuScale nearly doubled its cost estimates because of high interest rates and inflation.But a\\\\xa0handful of other first-of-a-kind projects in North America have received key approvals to start laying the early groundwork.In Ontario, Canada, regulators recently gave Ontario Power Generation the  to begin building a\\\\xa0four-unit SMR project at the Darlington nuclear site. The project will use the light-water  reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy — a\\\\xa0design that stretches the meaning of the word \\\\u200b“small.” A\\\\xa0single reactor building will reach an estimated 220\\\\xa0feet above ground and nearly 112\\\\xa0feet below\\\\xa0grade.The BWRX-300 units will each be capable of generating 300MW, or enough to power about 300,000 homes, with the first unit expected to be in service by the end of 2030. The total 1.2GW Darlington project could cost around  to complete.![]( rendering shows the BWRX-300 reactor installed at the Darlington nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. (OPG)In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority became the  to submit a\\\\xa0construction permit application — for the BWRX-300 — with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which accepted the application on July 10. After regulatory approval, which is expected by the end of 2026, the TVA plans to install the design at its Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and to commission the plant by\\\\xa02032.The startup Kairos Power is also developing an SMR project in Oak Ridge, but at a\\\\xa0much smaller scale and with a\\\\xa0less conventional design: a\\\\xa0molten fluoride salt coolant and a\\\\xa0higher-concentration uranium fuel recipe.The company aims to start operating a\\\\xa035MW thermal Hermes reactor as early as 2026, with a\\\\xa0commercial version to be deployed in the 2030s. On July 16, the company said it had  the reactor vessel for its third engineering test unit, which will inform the design of its first reactor. The Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to provide  for the $629 million project through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.![]( Power collaborated with Barnard Construction to install the reactor vessel for the non-nuclear Engineering Test Unit 3.0 at Kairos Power’s site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. (Kairos)Meanwhile, in Wyoming, Bill Gates’ startup TerraPower  nonnuclear construction work for a\\\\xa0345MW reactor near a\\\\xa0retiring coal plant in Kemmerer. The company’s Natrium reactor, which it aims to bring online in 2030, is a\\\\xa0sodium-cooled fast reactor with a\\\\xa0molten-salt-based storage system and is expected to cost up to $4 billion to complete — with the DOE slated to cover half of that tab through the demonstration program.The DOE launched the program in 2020, during the first Trump administration. Trump’s second administration is now doubling down on federal support for nuclear projects even as it  for other carbon-free power sources like wind and\\\\xa0solar.The administration wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050.\\\\xa0To get there, it has  accelerating the licensing process for new reactors and speeding up regulatory reviews, going as far as to  the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \\\\u200b“rubber stamp” new reactor designs.

And the anticipated dates for when they\\\\\\'ll produce power are almost certainly unrealistic. NuScale failed because local utilities decided the cost of electricity was going to be too high. The same problem exists for the various projects described in this article.R0 points3 months agoThe SMR PowerPoint industry, is just that. There were SMRs built in the U.S. in the 1950s-early 70s. they didn\\\\\\'t pan out economically, so the industry upped the size to get an economy of size advantage. These newer SMR designs would get a dis-economy of scale, costing more than the 2 large Vogtle reactors, recently completed. Vogtle will be about 30-33¢/kWh delivered, and these would probably be 40-50¢/kWh delivered.The industry has touted their economy of scale, but never mentions the economy of size. The economy of scale would not kick in if ever, until many units were built. The U.S. and French nuclear industries never experienced a learning curve, but instead kept going up in cost in real dollars. This is an economic bubble in the infant stages.R0 points3 months ago. . . As the article sub-caption says, \"Nuclear experts say 74 SMR designs are under active development worldwide.\" The industry has been saying that SMRs will help nuclear go with standardized designs. With 74 designs, it\\\\\\'s going go be a long time before any serious standardization occurs. Learning curves are higher when there is standardization. This does not look like standardization; it looks like a free-for-all to me.MMichael Leaf0 points3 months agoI highly recommend the research paper \"Smaller nuclear reactors (SMRs) are a costly dead end, especially for AI\" by Joseph Romm of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media: JJohn Unger0 points3 months agoWhat will we do with all of the additional waste if this nightmare of nuclear expansion occurs? We still have no viable plan for the waste already accumulated over decades. And the cost of these new reactors vs solar, wind and geothermal?

The idea is not to teach them to disregard all risk - we don’t want them jumping off cliffs or buildings.

On the other hand, Advanced nuclear is approximately DOUBLE this. So, do you want to bet for a miracle that will reduce the cost of advanced nuke, AND stop these projects from being a decade or more behind schedule? Or do you want to bet on one of the dozen-odd new, cheap, low-tech battery chemistries coming down in price, making battery + solar much cheaper than anything else?--->It\\\\\\'s clear that advanced nuke will be more expensive, and their lobbyists are just better.-EBA ( )NNathan Campbell0 points3 months agoPretty funny that on the link provided there is a whole section on how it is misleading to directly compare technologies across technologies. Then you proceed to do just that. The proper way to read the chart is to only compare what is in the same box, not between different boxes.

Small modular reactors, deployable either as single or multi-module plant, offer the possibility to combine nuclear with alternative energy sources, including renewables.## Small modular reactors: flexible and affordable power generationGlobal interest in small and medium sized or modular reactors has been increasing due to their ability to meet the need for flexible power generation for a wider range of users and applications and replace ageing fossil fuel-fired power plants. They also display an enhanced safety performance through inherent and passive safety features, offer better upfront capital cost affordability and are suitable for cogeneration and non-electric applications. In addition, they offer options for remote regions with less developed infrastructures and the possibility for synergetic hybrid energy systems that combine nuclear and alternate energy sources, including renewables.Many Member States are focusing on the development of small modular reactors, which are defined as advanced reactors that produce electricity of up to 300 MW(e) per module. These reactors have advanced engineered features, are deployable either as a single or multi-module plant, and are designed to be built in factories and shipped to utilities for installation as demand arises.There are more than 80 SMR designs and concepts globally. Most of them are in various developmental stages and some are claimed as being near-term deployable. There are currently four SMRs in advanced stages of construction in Argentina, China and Russia, and several existing and newcomer nuclear energy countries are conducting SMR research and development.The IAEA is coordinating the efforts of its Member States to develop SMRs of various types by taking a systematic approach to the identification and development of key enabling technologies, with the goal to achieve competitiveness and reliable performance of such reactors. The Agency also helps them address common infrastructure issues that could facilitate the SMRs’ deployment.## Related resources- - - ## Related News]( STORY### 8 September 2025]( STORY### 4 August 2025]( STORY### 10 June 2025]( STORY### 22 May 2025## Publications]( May 2025### ]( October 2024### ]( July 2024### ]( December 2023### #### More on the IAEA1. 2. 3. #### Scientific resources1. 2. 3. 4. #### Resources1. 2. 3. #### Documents1. 2. 3. 4. #### Stay in Touch          \\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_pqMgASSGZO50dUu7hasGsyNy', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'Plans For New Reactors Worldwide - World Nuclear Association\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide\\', \\'markdown\\': \" /  /  / Plans For New Reactors Worldwidecurrent and future generation# Plans For New Reactors WorldwideUpdated Thursday, 25 September 2025- **About 70\\\\xa0reactors are under construction across the world.

16Written By ![]( nuclear energy sector is poised for a transformative year in 2025, with key developments set to reshape the global energy landscape. According to the International Energy Agency, global nuclear power generation is expected to grow by nearly 3% annually through 2026, reaching a new all-time high by 2025. This surge will be driven by increased output from France, the restart of several plants in Japan, and the activation of new reactors across markets like China, India, South Korea, and Europe. Over the next few years, an additional 29 GW of nuclear capacity is anticipated to come online worldwide. As we look toward 2025, several groundbreaking advancements, strategic investments, and innovative projects will redefine the nuclear energy sector. Here’s a look at the top 10 nuclear energy developments set to make a significant impact in 2025.**1) Small Modular Reactors Leading the Way in 2025:**The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) landscape in 2025 showcases over 80 diverse designs, with NuScale’s VOYGR leading the pack, featuring 77 MW modules and certified by the US NRC. Other significant contenders include GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, Rolls-Royce, and Westinghouse’s AP300, each focused on delivering cost-effective solutions. The landscape is further diversified with innovations from companies like Holtec, China’s HTR-PM, Oklo’s liquid-metal reactors, Seaborg’s molten salt reactors, and Russia’s RITM series. While development continues, licensing and deployment challenges remain. Operational pilots, such as Russia’s floating plant and China’s HTR-PM, offer initial insights, yet broader commercial adoption lags behind. Ongoing research and development efforts emphasize enhancing safety, reducing costs, and identifying new applications for these technologies. SMRs present a substantial opportunity for decarbonization, offering the flexibility to be deployed in remote locations or industrial settings while integrating with renewable energy systems. Key competitors in this space include NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls-Royce, and Rosatom. Investment decisions, especially from the UK, are anticipated in 2025, potentially accelerating deployment efforts. As more pilot projects emerge, regulatory frameworks may evolve, and funding in the sector could increase. However, public perception, regulatory hurdles, and supply chain challenges remain critical barriers to widespread adoption.**2) Nuclear Energy’s Role in Data Centers and AI:**The rapid expansion of data centers and AI is driving a re-evaluation of nuclear energy as a viable solution to meet soaring electricity demands. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have emerged as the ideal candidate due to their scalability, safety features, and ability to provide a reliable, carbon-neutral power source. Companies such as NuScale, Oklo, and Rolls-Royce are working on custom solutions for this growing market. Tech giants have already secured substantial agreements to support this transition: Amazon with Dominion Energy and X-energy for 5 GW, Google with Kairos Power for 500 MW, Microsoft in talks to revive the Three Mile Island site, Meta pursuing 4 GW, and Switch collaborating with Oklo to secure a power supply. As we enter 2025, the first operational SMRs dedicated to data centers may come online, potentially from Deep Fission or Endeavour with their innovative underground designs. It is anticipated that regulatory bodies will advance frameworks to support the inclusion of nuclear power within the tech industry, while novel financial models could emerge to ease the transition. The successful collaboration of tech firms, nuclear developers, and governments will be pivotal in overcoming public perception challenges and safety concerns. As the demand for sustainable energy solutions increases, the role of nuclear energy in enabling carbon neutrality will grow. Despite this, challenges such as public resistance, high initial costs, and waste management remain significant hurdles. By 2025, we may see whether nuclear power will firmly establish itself as a key player in the digital age\\'s energy needs.]( Financing the Future of Nuclear Energy:**In 2024, 14 major global banks, including Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, pledged their support for nuclear energy during the New York Climate Week, aligning with COP28’s objective to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. This commitment underscores the recognition of nuclear energy’s potential to provide stable, clean power in the face of growing demands from sectors such as AI and data centers. Looking ahead, the financial landscape for nuclear energy is poised for growth, with a strong focus on innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds and risk-sharing models. These financial institutions’ backing could have a profound influence on global policy, pushing nuclear energy to the forefront of clean energy strategies. By 2025, more concrete financial commitments are expected, with new models such as blended finance emerging to attract private investment. This support could stabilize nuclear-related stocks, thus stimulating private sector interest. However, challenges such as cost management, lengthy project timelines, and public acceptance still need to be addressed. Successfully overcoming these hurdles will be crucial in solidifying nuclear energy’s place in the global clean energy landscape by 2025.**4) Innovations in Nuclear Reactor Technology:**Nuclear reactor technology is evolving rapidly, with key innovations that could significantly impact the future of energy production. Notable developments include Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) from companies such as Kairos Power and Terrestrial Energy, which are focused on increasing safety and efficiency, with commercial applications expected by the mid-2030s.

Fast reactors, such as TerraPower’s Natrium, are exploring the potential for sustainable nuclear power. These designs feature passive safety systems and modular construction, enhancing both safety and cost-effectiveness. These advanced reactors are not only well-suited to generate electricity but also provide industrial heat, aiding in decarbonization efforts and integrating seamlessly with renewable energy sources for stable power generation. Some designs also focus on addressing nuclear waste management. By 2025, regulatory approvals for these cutting-edge reactor designs may progress, bringing us closer to commercial demonstrations in industrial applications. As investment in these technologies increases, we anticipate new pilot projects to demonstrate real-world applications, with several countries expected to initiate or expand their nuclear programs. Technological refinement will continue, with an increasing emphasis on digital management to enhance operational efficiency. However, fully integrating these reactors into the global energy mix will require overcoming existing challenges and navigating complex regulatory landscapes.]( Advances in Nuclear Fuel Technology:**By 2025, nuclear fuel technology is poised for significant advancements. Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATFs), which offer enhanced safety features, are set to enter commercial trials, marking a major step forward in reactor safety. High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) is expected to become more readily available, providing a crucial component for the next generation of reactors. TRISO fuel, recognized for its safety and performance, will be commercially produced, with X-energy taking the lead in its deployment. Additionally, thorium fuels are under exploration, particularly in India, for their potential advantages in terms of waste reduction and proliferation resistance. Efforts are also underway to advance nuclear fuel recycling technologies, with new facilities potentially coming online in the coming years. Innovations such as 3D printing for intricate fuel designs and advanced modeling techniques for performance predictions will further enhance the efficiency and safety of nuclear operations. However, key challenges remain, including regulatory clarity, cost considerations, and securing public acceptance. By 2025, we anticipate progress toward the integration of these advanced fuels into both existing and future nuclear systems, which could transform the nuclear energy landscape and drive further efficiency and sustainability in the sector.**6) Newcomers to the Nuclear Energy Landscape:**Several countries are actively working to diversify their energy portfolios by pursuing nuclear energy. Indonesia is advancing its nuclear power plans with a goal of contributing 5.3 GW by 2032, with construction expected to begin in the same year. Malaysia, in late 2024, announced its intent to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels by developing nuclear power capabilities. Kazakhstan is set to make key decisions regarding the construction of up to three nuclear plants, with 2025 earmarked for site selection and international technology partnerships. Poland’s first commercial nuclear power plant is slated to begin operations in 2036, with the first concrete pour expected in 2028 as part of an updated nuclear energy strategy. Ghana aims to commission its nuclear plant by 2030, signaling a commitment to clean energy. Each of these countries is driven by goals of energy security, sustainability, and climate change mitigation, all while navigating challenges related to public acceptance and securing the necessary financial backing.**7) Nuclear-Powered Clean Hydrogen Production:**The production of clean hydrogen via nuclear energy is progressing, with nuclear reactors providing both the electricity and heat necessary for efficient electrolysis. Notable projects driving this effort include Constellation’s Nine Mile Point in the US, EDF’s initiatives in France, and Japan’s HTTR. Policy support, such as US tax credits, is designed to capitalize on existing nuclear infrastructure to produce hydrogen efficiently. Despite this, challenges remain, including high costs, regulatory clarity, and public concerns surrounding safety. The next few years promise technological breakthroughs that could drive down hydrogen production costs, with the potential to expand its applications across industries, transportation, and energy storage. Upcoming reactor designs will likely optimize hydrogen generation, and by 2025, more pilot projects should be operational. A clearer policy framework could stimulate investment, while advancements in electrolysis technology and efforts to address public concerns will be key. Integration with renewable energy could also bolster hydrogen’s role in the global clean energy mix. While nuclear hydrogen is not yet widespread, 2025 could be a transformative year in establishing its place in sustainable energy strategies.]( India’s Bharat Small Reactors:**Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs) are positioned to revolutionize nuclear energy deployment in India, focusing on decentralizing energy production for energy-intensive industries such as steel and cement while supporting the country’s broader decarbonization goals. This initiative, highlighted in the 2024-25 Union Budget, marks a strategic partnership between the Indian government and private industry to develop BSRs, with the target of increasing nuclear capacity from 8,180 MW to 22,480 MW by 2031-32 and 100 GW by 2047. These BSRs are based on India’s 220 MW PHWR technology, adapted to produce smaller, more flexible units. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is leading research into this promising new technology. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) has issued Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to engage the private sector in financing and constructing BSRs, with NPCIL retaining operational control. The RFP submission deadline of March 31, 2025, signals the urgency of moving forward with this initiative. By 2025, agreements may be finalized, paving the way for construction or detailed planning of BSR projects. This ambitious move will contribute to India’s energy security, decarbonization efforts, and regional energy independence.**9) Türkiye’s Growing Nuclear Ambitions:**Türkiye has set its sights on reaching 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Central to this initiative is the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in Mersin, which features four VVER-1200 reactors designed to deliver a total capacity of 4,800 MW. This flagship project is being developed under a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) model by Russia’s state-owned Rosatom. Originally slated to begin operations in 2023, the first reactor is now set to come online in 2025, with full operational capacity expected by 2028.Beyond Akkuyu, Türkiye has outlined ambitious plans for additional nuclear power plants. The Sinop project on the Black Sea is set to continue the collaboration with Rosatom, following the successful partnership on Akkuyu. Furthermore, Türkiye is exploring another plant in Thrace, where talks with China are ongoing. China’s State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) has emerged as the leading bidder for this project.In 2025, Türkiye expects the first unit of Akkuyu to enter trial operations, marking the country’s entry into nuclear energy production. This year will also witness further advancements in Türkiye’s nuclear regulatory framework, which will prioritize safety and emergency response protocols. Furthermore, negotiations regarding the Sinop and Thrace projects are expected to progress, potentially resulting in new partnerships and funding agreements.]( Africa’s Nuclear Energy Expansion:**Africa is rapidly increasing its focus on nuclear energy to drive economic development and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Several African nations are moving forward with nuclear power projects, Rwanda demonstrated its commitment to advanced nuclear technology through agreements with Nano Nuclear Energy and Dual Fluid Energy, aiming to introduce both small modular reactors and an experimental reactor. In South Africa, the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) gained significant momentum with the HTMR-100 project, which secured a ZAR9 billion (USD 480 million) financing deal between Koya Capital and Stratek Global.Ghana established itself as a leader in nuclear education by launching Africa\\'s first Regional Clean Energy Training Centre, developed in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC). This center is dedicated to training a workforce adept at managing nuclear energy projects throughout Africa. Additionally, at the 26th World Energy Congress in Rotterdam, Nuclear Power Ghana and CNNC Overseas Limited formalized a cooperation agreement for deploying a Hualong One (HPR-1000) nuclear power project. Meanwhile, in Egypt, Rosatom reported substantial progress at the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, with approximately 30% of the project completed by the end of 2024, signaling a significant step forward in North Africa\\'s nuclear ambitions. These developments collectively underscore a year of considerable advancement and strategic partnerships in the African nuclear energy landscape.This year will witness for major developments in this regard, the continent has the potential to achieve 15 GW of operational nuclear capacity by 2035, demonstrating the pivotal role of nuclear energy in fostering economic growth and advancing climate action. Leading this transformative effort are nations such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco, which have made significant strides in their nuclear energy programs.In short, the year 2025 promises to be a transformative period for the nuclear energy sector, driven by advancements in technology, regulatory reforms, and international collaborations. With growing support for clean energy solutions and a heightened focus on energy security, nuclear power is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future energy landscape. As these developments unfold, businesses and governments must stay agile and proactive, capitalizing on opportunities to harness the full potential of nuclear energy for a sustainable and prosperous future.]( Coelho]( Powers Up: Full Steam Ahead for Nuclear Energy**]( \"}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_R6HNhyC1U9UBUM7KCV3nswGd', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'Global nuclear power capacity additions - Visualizing Energy\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://visualizingenergy.org/global-nuclear-power-capacity-additions/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"- # Global nuclear power capacity additions- Date Published: September 15, 2025- Written by:- Visualized by:The potential for a power plant to generate electricity is measured by its nameplate capacity, or simply capacity, which is the rate of electricity generation at continuous full power measured in watts.

We address the energy system itself (sources, conversion, end use), economics (prices, investment, market failures), social outcomes (well-being, energy poverty, and climate justice), and environmental change (climate, pollution, and land and water use).### How are we differentThe internet is awash in information about energy, climate change, and health impacts of pollution. But society is deficient in a shared understanding of how our energy system must change. One reason for that is that information is siloed by technology, policy, and disciplines. We use the unique role of energy in human affairs and natural systems as the unifying principle behind compelling, data-driven stories that point to solutions that are feasible, affordable, and equitable. We are interdisciplinary and collaborative, working with diverse teams and perspectives that span the broad energy landscape.### Open accessVisualizing Energy aims to accelerate a sustainable energy transition by deploying a more equitable system of knowledge.

The United States has the most capacity, followed by France, China, Russia, and South Korea, based on  (IAEA) data as of June 2025. Globally, 416 nuclear power reactors are operating in 31 countries, with a total installed  of 376 gigawatts (GW).The development of nuclear power plants for commercial electricity generation began in the United States in the late 1950s with the commissioning of the  in Pennsylvania. Most of the operating U.S. nuclear generating capacity was constructed between 1967 and 1990.Electric utilities in the United States currently operate , and the country is the world\\'s largest producer of nuclear electricity.

The U.S. nuclear reactor fleet operates at a comparatively high  (92% in 2024) because of increased utility efficiency in managing planned and unplanned generation outages.France maintains the second-largest nuclear reactor fleet in the world and the largest nuclear reactor fleet in Europe with  with a total installed generating capacity of 63 GW. Nuclear reactors in France generated over  of electricity in 2023, which was nearly 65% of the country’s total electricity generation.

Chernobyl involved an intense fire without provision for containment, and Fukushima Daiichi severely tested the containment, allowing some release of radioactivity.**- **These are the only major accidents to have occurred in over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 36 countries.**- **The evidence over six decades shows that nuclear power is a safe means of generating electricity. The risk of accidents in nuclear power plants is low and declining. The consequences of an accident or terrorist attack are minimal compared with other commonly accepted risks. Radiological effects on people of any radioactive releases can be avoided.**In relation to nuclear power, safety is closely linked with security, and in the nuclear field also with safeguards. Some distinctions apply:- Safety focuses on unintended conditions or events leading to radiological releases from authorized activities. It relates mainly to intrinsic problems or hazards.- Security focuses on the intentional misuse of nuclear or other radioactive materials by non-state elements to cause harm. It relates mainly to external threats to materials or facilities (ee information page on ).- Safeguarding focuses on restraining activities by states that could lead to acquisition or development of nuclear weapons. It concerns mainly materials and equipment in relation to rogue governments (see information page on ).No industry is immune from accidents, but all industries learn from them. In civil aviation, there are accidents every year and each is meticulously analysed. The lessons from nearly one hundred years’ experience mean that reputable airlines are extremely safe. In the chemical industry and oil-gas industry, major accidents also lead to improved safety. There is wide public acceptance that the risks associated with these industries are an acceptable trade-off for our dependence on their products and services. With nuclear power, the high energy density makes the potential hazard obvious, and this has always been factored into the design of nuclear power plants. The few accidents have been spectacular and newsworthy, but of little consequence in terms of human fatalities. The novelty value and hence newsworthiness of nuclear power accidents remains high in contrast with other industrial accidents, which receive comparatively little news coverage.## Harnessing the world\\\\\\'s most concentrated energy sourceIn the 1950s attention turned to harnessing the power of the atom in a controlled way, as demonstrated at Chicago in 1942 and subsequently for military research, and applying the steady heat yield to generate electricity. This naturally gave rise to concerns about accidents and their possible effects.\\\\xa0However, with nuclear power, safety depends on much the same factors as in any comparable industry: intelligent planning, proper design with conservative margins and back-up systems, high-quality components and a well-developed safety culture in operations.\\\\xa0The operating lives of reactors depend on maintaining their safety margin.A particular nuclear scenario was loss of cooling which resulted in melting of the nuclear reactor core, and this motivated studies on both the physical and chemical possibilities as well as the biological effects of any dispersed radioactivity. Those responsible for nuclear power technology in the West devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring that a meltdown of the reactor core would not take place, since it was assumed that a meltdown of the core would create a major public hazard, and if uncontained, a tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities.In avoiding such accidents the industry has been very successful. In the 60-year history of civil nuclear power generation, with over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years across 36 countries, there have been only three significant accidents at nuclear power plants:-  (USA 1979) where the reactor was severely damaged but radiation was contained and there were no adverse health or environmental consequences.-  (Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of the reactor by steam explosion and fire killed two people initially plus a further 28 from radiation poisoning within three months, and had significant health and environmental consequences.- \\\\xa0(Japan 2011) where three old reactors (together with a fourth) were written off after the effects of loss of cooling due to a huge tsunami were inadequately contained.\\\\xa0There were no deaths or serious injuries due to radioactivity, though about 19,500 people were killed by the tsunami.Of all the accidents and incidents, only the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents resulted in radiation doses to the public greater than those resulting from the exposure to natural sources. The Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation exposure of workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their health, unlike Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one \\\\\\'accident\\\\\\') have been completely confined to the plant.Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident. Most of the serious radiological injuries and deaths that occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures above regulatory limits) are the result of large uncontrolled radiation sources, such as abandoned medical or industrial equipment. (There have also been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing pile – at Windscale, UK, in 1957\\\\xa0– but none of these resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination.) \\\\xa0See also Table in .!It should be emphasized that a commercial-type power reactor simply cannot under any circumstances explode like a nuclear bomb – the fuel is not enriched beyond about 5%, and much higher enrichment is needed for explosives.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was set up by the United Nations in 1957. One of its functions was to act as an auditor of world nuclear safety, and this role was increased greatly following the Chernobyl accident.\\\\xa0It prescribes safety procedures and the reporting of even minor incidents. Its role has been strengthened since 1996 (see ). Every country which operates nuclear power plants has a nuclear safety inspectorate and all of these work closely with the IAEA.While nuclear power plants are designed to be safe in their operation and safe in the event of any malfunction or accident, no industrial activity can be represented as entirely risk-free. Incidents and accidents may happen, and as in other industries, what is learned will lead to a progressive improvement in safety.\\\\xa0Those improvements are both in new designs, and in upgrading of existing plants. The long-term operation (LTO) of established plants is achieved by significant investment in such upgrading.The safety of operating staff is a prime concern in nuclear plants. Radiation exposure is minimized by the use of remote handling equipment for many operations in the core of the reactor. Other controls include physical shielding and limiting the time workers spend in areas with significant radiation levels. These are supported by continuous monitoring of individual doses and of the work environment to ensure very low radiation exposure compared with other industries.The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation can be considered extremely safe. Every year several hundred people die in coal mines to provide this widely used fuel for electricity. There are also significant health and environmental effects arising from fossil fuel use. Contrary to popular belief, nuclear power saves lives by displacing fossil fuel from the electricity mix.## Achieving safety: the reactor coreConcerning possible accidents, up to the early 1970s, some extreme assumptions were made about the possible chain of consequences. These gave rise to a genre of dramatic fiction (e.g.\\\\xa0_The China Syndrome_) in the public domain and also some solid conservative engineering including containment structures in the industry itself. Licensing regulations were framed accordingly.It was not until the late 1970s that detailed analyses and large-scale testing, followed by the 1979 meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor, began to make clear that even the worst possible accident in a conventional western nuclear power plant or its fuel would not be likely to cause dramatic public harm. The industry still works hard to minimize the probability of a meltdown accident, but it is now clear that no-one need fear a potential public health catastrophe simply because a fuel meltdown happens. Fukushima Daiichi has made that clear, with a triple meltdown causing no fatalities or serious radiation doses to anyone, while over two hundred people continued working onsite to mitigate the accident\\\\\\'s effects.The decades-long test and analysis programme showed that less radioactivity escapes from molten fuel than initially assumed, and that most of this radioactive material is not readily mobilized beyond the immediate internal structure. Thus, even if the containment structure that surrounds all modern nuclear plants were ruptured, as was the case with one of the Fukushima reactors, it is still very effective in preventing the escape of most radioactivity.A mandated safety indicator is the calculated probable frequency of degraded core or core melt accidents. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) specifies that reactor designs must meet a theoretical 1 in 10,000 year core damage frequency, but modern designs exceed this. US utility requirements are 1 in 100,000 years, the best currently operating plants are about 1 in one million and those likely to be built in the next decade are almost 1 in 10 million. While this calculated core damage frequency has been one of the main metrics to assess reactor safety, European safety authorities prefer a deterministic approach, focusing on actual provision of back-up hardware, though they also undertake probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) for core damage frequency,\\\\xa0and require a 1 in 1 million core damage frequency for new designs.Even months after the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in 1979 it was assumed that there had been no core melt because there were no indications of severe radioactive release even inside the containment. It turned out that in fact about half the core had melted. Until 2011 this remained the only core melt in a reactor conforming to NRC safety criteria, and the effects were contained as designed, without radiological harm to anyone.* Greifswald 5 in East Germany had a partial core melt in November 1989, due to malfunctioning valves (root cause: shoddy manufacture) and was never restarted. At Fukushima in 2011 (a different reactor design with penetrations in the bottom of the pressure vessel) the three reactor cores evidently largely melted in the first two or three days, but this was not confirmed for about ten weeks. It is still not certain how much of the core material was not contained by the pressure vessels and ended up in the bottom of the drywell containments, though certainly there was considerable release of radionuclides to the atmosphere early on, and later to cooling water**.* About this time there was alarmist talk of the so-called \\\\\\'China Syndrome\\\\\\', a scenario where the core of such a reactor would melt, and due to continual heat generation, melt its way through the reactor pressure vessel and concrete foundations to keep going, perhaps until it reached China on the other side of the globe! The TMI accident proved the extent of truth in the proposition, and the molten core material got exactly 15 mm of the way to China as it froze on the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel.** Ignoring isotopic differences, there are about one hundred different fission products in fuel which has been undergoing fission. A few of these are gases at normal temperatures, more are volatile at higher temperatures, and both will be released from the fuel if the cladding is damaged. The latter include iodine (easily volatilized, at 184°C) and caesium (671°C), which were the main radionuclides released at Fukushima, first into the reactor pressure vessel and then into the containment which in unit 2 apparently ruptured early on day 5. In addition, as cooling water was flushed through the hot core, soluble fission products such as caesium dissolved in it, which created the need for a large water treatment plant to remove them.Apart from these accidents and the Chernobyl disaster there have been about ten core melt accidents – mostly in military or experimental reactors –  lists most of them. None resulted in any hazard outside the plant from the core melting, though in one case there was significant radiation release due to burning fuel in hot graphite (similar to Chernobyl but smaller scale). The Fukushima accident should also be considered in that context, since the fuel was badly damaged and there were significant off-site radiation releases.Licensing approval for new plants today requires that the effects of any core-melt accident must be confined to the plant itself, without the need to evacuate nearby residents.The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material, leading to contamination and consequent radiation exposure off-site. Earlier assumptions were that this would be likely in the event of a major loss of cooling accident (LOCA) which resulted in a core melt. The TMI experience suggested otherwise, but at Fukushima this is exactly what happened. In the light of better understanding of the physics and chemistry of material in a reactor core under extreme conditions it became evident that even a severe core melt coupled with breach of containment would be unlikely to create a major radiological disaster from many Western reactor designs, but the Fukushima accident showed that this did not apply to all. Studies of the post-accident situation at TMI (where there was no breach of containment) supported the suggestion, and analysis of Fukushima will be incomplete until the reactors are dismantled.Certainly the matter was severely tested with three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in March 2011. Cooling was lost about an hour after a shutdown, and it proved impossible to restore it sufficiently to prevent severe damage to the fuel. The reactors, dating from 1971-75, were written off. A fourth is also written off due to damage from a hydrogen explosion.## Achieving optimum nuclear safetyA fundamental principle of nuclear power plant operation worldwide is that the operator is responsible for safety. The national regulator is responsible for ensuring the plants are operated safely by the licensee, and that the design is approved. A second important concept is that a regulator’s mission is to protect people and the environment.Design certification of reactors is also the responsibility of national regulators. There is international collaboration among these to varying degrees, and\\\\xa0there are a number of sets of mechanical codes and standards related to quality and safety.With new reactor designs being established on a more international basis since the 1990s, both the industry and regulators are seeking greater design standardization and also regulatory harmonization. The role of the World Nuclear Association\\\\\\'s Cooperation in Reactor Design Evaluation and Licensing (CORDEL) Working Group and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency\\\\\\'s (NEA\\\\\\'s) Multinational Design Evaluation Programme (MDEP) are described in the information page on\\\\xa0.An OECD-NEA report in 2010 pointed out that the theoretically-calculated frequency for a large release of radioactivity from a severe nuclear power plant accident has reduced by a factor of 1600 between the early Generation I reactors as originally built and the Generation III/III+ plants being built today. Earlier designs however have been progressively upgraded through their operating lives.It has long been asserted that nuclear reactor accidents are the epitome of low-probability but high-consequence risks. Understandably, with this in mind, some people were disinclined to accept the risk, however low the probability. However, the physics and chemistry of a reactor core, coupled with but not wholly depending on the engineering, mean that the consequences of an accident are likely in fact be much less severe than those from other industrial and energy sources. Experience, including Fukushima, bears this out.A 2009 US Department of Energy (DOE)  notes: \"The aviation industry, medical industry, commercial nuclear power industry, US Navy, DOE and its contractors, and other high-risk, technologically complex organizations have adopted human performance principles, concepts, and practices to consciously reduce human error and bolster controls in order to reduce accidents and events... About 80% of all events are attributed to human error. In some industries, this number is closer to 90%. Roughly 20% of events involve equipment failures. When the 80% human error is broken down further, it reveals that the majority of errors associated with events stem from latent organizational weaknesses (perpetrated by humans in the past that lie dormant in the system), whereas about 30% are caused by the individual worker touching the equipment and systems in the facility. Clearly, focusing efforts on reducing human error will reduce the likelihood of events.\" Following the Fukushima accident the focus has been on the organizational weaknesses which increase the likelihood of human error.### Defence-in-depthTo achieve optimum safety, nuclear plants in the western world operate using a **\\\\\\'defence-in-depth\\\\\\' approach**, with multiple safety systems supplementing the natural features of the reactor core. Key aspects of the approach are:- High-quality design & construction.- Equipment which prevents operational disturbances or human failures and errors developing into problems.- Comprehensive monitoring and regular testing to detect equipment or operator failures.- Redundant and diverse systems to control damage to the fuel and prevent significant radioactive releases.- Provision to confine the effects of severe fuel damage (or any other problem) to the plant itself.These can be summed up as: prevention, monitoring, and action (to mitigate consequences of failures).The safety provisions include a series of physical barriers between the radioactive reactor core and the environment, the provision of multiple safety systems, each with backup and designed to accommodate human error. As well as the physical aspects of safety, there are institutional aspects which are no less important – see following section on International Collaboration.The barriers in a typical plant are: the fuel is in the form of solid ceramic (UO2) pellets, and radioactive fission products remain largely bound inside these pellets as the fuel is burned. The pellets are packed inside sealed zirconium alloy tubes to form fuel rods. These are confined inside a large steel pressure vessel with walls up to 30 cm thick – the associated primary water cooling pipework is also substantial. All this, in turn, is enclosed inside a robust reinforced concrete containment structure with walls at least one metre thick. This amounts to three significant barriers around the fuel, which itself is stable up to very high temperatures.These barriers are monitored continually. The fuel cladding is monitored by measuring the amount of radioactivity in the cooling water. The high pressure cooling system is monitored by the leak rate of water, and the containment structure by periodically measuring the leak rate of air at about five times atmospheric pressure.Looked at functionally, the three basic safety functions in a nuclear reactor are:- To control reactivity.- To cool the fuel.- To contain radioactive substances.The main safety features of most reactors are inherent – negative temperature coefficient and negative void coefficient. The first means that beyond an optimal level, as the temperature increases the efficiency of the reaction decreases (this in fact is used to control power levels in some new designs). The second means that if any steam has formed in the cooling water there is a decrease in moderating effect so that fewer neutrons are able to cause fission and the reaction slows down automatically.In the 1950s and 1960s some experimental reactors in Idaho were deliberately tested to destruction to verify that large reactivity excursions were self-limiting and would automatically shut down the fission reaction. These tests verified that this was the case.Beyond the control rods which are inserted to absorb neutrons and regulate the fission process, the main engineered safety provisions are the back-up emergency core cooling system (ECCS) to remove excess heat (though it is more to prevent damage to the plant than for public safety) and the containment.Traditional reactor safety systems are \\\\\\'active\\\\\\' in the sense that they involve electrical or mechanical operation on command. Some engineered systems operate passively, e.g. pressure relief valves. Both require parallel redundant systems. Inherent or full passive safety design depends only on physical phenomena such as convection, gravity or resistance to high temperatures, not on functioning of engineered components. All reactors have some elements of inherent safety as mentioned above, but in some recent designs the passive or inherent features substitute for active systems in cooling etc. Such a design would have averted the Fukushima accident, where loss of electrical power resulted is loss of cooling function.The basis of design assumes a threat where due to accident or malign intent (e.g. terrorism) there is core melting and a breach of containment. This double possibility has been well studied and provides the basis of exclusion zones and contingency plans. Apparently during the Cold War neither Russia nor the USA targeted the other\\\\\\'s nuclear power plants because the likely damage would be modest.Nuclear power plants are designed with sensors to shut them down automatically in an earthquake, and this is a vital consideration in many parts of the world. (See    paper)## Severe accident managementIn addition to engineering and procedures which reduce the risk and severity of accidents, all plants have guidelines for severe accident management or mitigation (SAM). These conspicuously came into play after the Fukushima accident, where staff had immense challenges in the absence of power and with disabled cooling systems following damage done by the tsunami. The experience following that accident is being applied not only in design but also in such guidelines, and peer reviews on nuclear plants are focusing more on these than previously.In mid-2011 the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre launched a new secure web-based communications platform to unify and simplify information exchange during nuclear or radiological emergencies. The Unified System for Information Exchange on Incidents and Emergencies (USIE) has been under development since 2009 but was actually launched during the emergency response to the accident at Fukushima.In both the TMI and Fukushima accidents the problems started after the reactors were shut down – immediately at TMI and after an hour at Fukushima, when the tsunami arrived. The need to remove decay heat from the fuel was not met in each case, so core melting started to occur within a few hours. Cooling requires water circulation and an external heat sink. If pumps cannot run due to lack of power, gravity must be relied upon, but this will not get water into a pressurized system – either reactor pressure vessel or containment. Hence there is provision for relieving pressure, sometimes with a vent system, but this must work and be controlled without power. There is a question of filters or scrubbers in the vent system: these need to be such that they do not block due to solids being carried. Ideally any vent system should deal with any large amounts of hydrogen, as at Fukushima, and have minimum potential to spread radioactivity outside the plant.\\\\xa0Filtered containment ventilation systems (FCVSs) have been retrofitted to some reactors which did not already have them, or any of sufficient capacity, following the Fukushima accident. The basic premise of a FCVS is that, independent of the state of the reactor itself, the catastrophic failure of the containment structure can be avoided by discharging steam, air and incondensable gases like hydrogen to the atmosphere.The Three Mile Island accident in 1979\\\\xa0demonstrated the importance of the inherent safety features. Despite the fact that about half of the reactor core melted, radionuclides released from the melted fuel mostly plated out on the inside of the plant or dissolved in condensing steam. The containment building which housed the reactor further prevented any significant release of radioactivity. The accident was attributed to mechanical failure and operator confusion. The reactor\\\\\\'s other protection systems also functioned as designed. The emergency core cooling system would have prevented any damage to the reactor but for the intervention of the operators.Investigations following the accident led to a new focus on the human factors in nuclear safety. No major design changes were called for in western reactors, but controls and instrumentation were improved significantly and operator training was overhauled.At Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 the three operating reactors shut down automatically, and were being cooled as designed by the normal residual heat removal system using power from the back-up generators, until the tsunami swamped them an hour later. The emergency core cooling systems then failed. Days later, a separate problem emerged as spent fuel ponds lost water. Analysis of the accident showed the need for more intelligent siting criteria than those used in the 1960s, and the need for better back-up power and post-shutdown cooling, as well as provision for venting the containment of that kind of reactor and other emergency management procedures.Nuclear plants have Severe Accident Mitigation Guidelines (SAMG, or in Japan: SAG), and most of these,\\\\xa0including all those in the USA, address what should be done for accidents beyond design basis, and where several systems may be disabled. See section below.In 2007 the US NRC launched a research program to assess the possible consequences of a serious reactor accident. Its draft report was released nearly a year after the Fukushima accident had partly confirmed its findings. The State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequences Analysis (SOARCA) showed that a severe accident at a US nuclear power plant (PWR or BWR) would not be likely to cause any immediate deaths, and the risks of fatal cancers would be vastly less than the general risks of cancer. SOARCA\\\\\\'s main conclusions fall into three areas: how a reactor accident progresses; how existing systems and emergency measures can affect an accident\\\\\\'s outcome; and how an accident would affect the public\\\\\\'s health. The principal conclusion is that existing resources and procedures can stop an accident, slow it down or reduce its impact before it can affect the public, but even if accidents proceed without such mitigation they take much longer to happen and release much less radioactive material than earlier analyses suggested. \\\\xa0This was borne out at Fukushima, where there was ample time for evacuation – three days – before any significant radioactive releases.In 2015 the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) released its . This was the result of research and analysis undertaken to address concerns raised during public hearings in 2012 on the environmental assessment for the refurbishment of Ontario Power Generation\\\\\\'s (OPG\\\\\\'s) Darlington nuclear power plant. The study involved identifying and modelling a large atmospheric release of radionuclides from a hypothetical severe nuclear accident at the four-unit Darlington power plant; estimating the doses to individuals at various distances from the plant, after factoring in protective actions such as evacuation that would be undertaken in response to such an emergency; and, finally, determining human health and environmental consequences due to the resulting radiation exposure. It concluded that there would be no detectable health effects or increase in cancer risk. A  is on the World Nuclear News website.## A different safety philosophy: early Soviet-designed reactorsThe April 1986 disaster at the  in Ukraine was the result of major design deficiencies in the RBMK type of reactor, the violation of operating procedures and the absence of a safety culture. One peculiar feature of the RBMK design was that coolant failure could lead to a strong increase in power output from the fission process (positive void coefficient). However, this was not the prime cause of the Chernobyl accident.\\\\xa0It once and for all vindicated the desirability of designing with inherent safety supplemented by robust secondary safety provisions. By way of contrast to western safety engineering, the Chernobyl reactor did not have a containment structure like those used in the West or in post-1980 Soviet designs.The accident destroyed the reactor, and its burning contents dispersed radionuclides far and wide. This tragically meant that the results were severe, with 56 people killed, 28 of whom died within weeks from radiation exposure. It also caused radiation sickness in a further 200-300 staff and firefighters, and contaminated large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and beyond. It is estimated that at least 5% of the total radioactive material in the Chernobyl 4 reactor core was released from the plant, due to the lack of any containment structure. Most of this was deposited as dust close by. Some was carried by wind over a wide area.About 130,000 people received significant  ( _i.e._ above internationally accepted ICRP limits) and continue to be monitored. According to an UNSCEAR report in 2018, about 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed in 1991-2015 in patients who were 18 and under at the time of the accident. The report states that a quarter of the cases in 2001-2008 were \"probably\" due to high doses of radiation, and that this fraction was likely to have been higher in earlier years, and lower in later years. However, it also states that the uncertainty around the attributed fraction is very significant – at least 0.07 to 0.5\\\\xa0– and that the influence of annual screenings and active follow-up make comparisons with the general population problematic. Thyroid cancer is usually not fatal if diagnosed and treated early; the report states that of the diagnoses made between 1991 and 2005 (6,848 cases), 15 proved to be fatal. No increase in leukaemia or other cancers have yet shown up, but some is expected. The World Health Organization is closely monitoring most of those affected.The Chernobyl accident was a unique event and the only time in the history of commercial nuclear power that radiation-related fatalities occurred.\\\\xa0The main positive outcome of this accident for the industry was the formation of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), building on the US precedent.The destroyed unit 4 was enclosed in a concrete shelter, which was replaced by a more permanent structure in 2017.An OECD expert report on the accident concluded: \"The Chernobyl accident has not brought to light any new, previously unknown phenomena or safety issues that are not resolved or otherwise covered by current reactor safety programs for commercial power reactors in OECD member countries.\" In other words, the concept of \\\\\\'defence in depth\\\\\\' was conspicuous by its absence, and tragically shown to be vitally important.Apart from the RBMK reactor design, an early Russian PWR design, the VVER-440/V-230, gave rise to concerns in Europe, and a program was initiated to close these down as a condition of EU accession, along with Lithuania’s two RBMK units. See related papers on , and .However, after the US Atomic Energy Commission published General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants in 1971, Russian PWR designs conformed, according to Rosatom. In particular, the VVER-440/V-213 Loviisa reactors in Finland were designed at that time and modified to conform. The first of these two came on line in 1977.## A broader picture – other past accidentsThere have been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing reactor, including a number of core melts, but none of these has resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination. Elsewhere ( _Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors_ ) we tabulate these, along with the most serious commercial plant accidents. The list of ten probably corresponds to incidents rating level 4 or higher on today’s International Nuclear Event Scale (Table 4). All except Browns Ferry and Vandellos involved damage to or malfunction of the reactor core. At Browns Ferry a fire damaged control cables and resulted in an 18-month shutdown for repairs; at Vandellos a turbine fire made the 17-year old plant uneconomic to repair.Mention should be made of the accident to the US Fermi 1 prototype fast breeder reactor near Detroit in 1966. Due to a blockage in coolant flow, some of the fuel melted. However no radiation was released offsite and no-one was injured. The reactor was repaired and restarted but closed down in 1972.The well-publicized criticality accident at Tokai Mura, Japan, in 1999 was at a fuel preparation plant for experimental reactors, and killed two workers from radiation exposure. Many other such criticality accidents have occurred, some fatal, and practically all in military facilities prior to 1980. A review of these is listed in the _References_ section.In an uncontained reactor accident such as at Windscale (a military facility) in 1957 and at Chernobyl in 1986 (and to some extent Fukushima Daiichi in 2011), the principal health hazard is from the spread of radioactive materials, notably volatile fission products such as iodine-131 and caesium-137. These are biologically active, so that if consumed in food, they tend to stay in organs of the body. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days, so is a hazard for around the first month, (and apparently gave rise to the thyroid cancers after the Chernobyl accident). Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years, and is therefore potentially a long-term contaminant of pastures and crops. In addition to these, there is caesium-134 which has a half-life of about two years. While measures can be taken to limit human uptake of I-131, (evacuation of area for several weeks, iodide tablets), high levels of radioactive caesium can preclude food production from affected land for a long time. Other radioactive materials in a reactor core have been shown to be less of a problem because they are either not volatile (strontium, transuranic elements) or not biologically active (tellurium-132, xenon-133).Accidents in any field of technology provide valuable knowledge enabling incremental improvement in safety beyond the original engineering. Cars and airliners are the most obvious examples of this, but the chemical and oil industries can provide even stronger evidence. Civil nuclear power has greatly improved its safety in both engineering and operation over its 65 years of experience with very few accidents and major incidents to spur that improvement. The Fukushima Daiichi accident was the first since TMI in 1979 which will have significant implications, at least for older plants.## Scrams, seismic shutdownsA scram is a sudden reactor shutdown. When a reactor is scrammed, automatically due to seismic activity, or due to some malfunction, or manually for whatever reason, the fission reaction generating the main heat stops. However, considerable heat continues to be generated by the radioactive decay of the fission products in the fuel. Initially, for a few minutes, this is great\\\\xa0– about 7% of the pre-scram level. But it drops to about 1% of the normal heat output after two hours, to 0.5% after one day, and 0.2% after a week. Even then it must still be cooled, but simply being immersed in a lot of water does most of the job after some time. When the water temperature is below 100°C at atmospheric pressure the reactor is said to be in \"cold shutdown\".## European \\\\\\'stress tests\\\\\\' and US response following Fukushima accidentAspects of nuclear plant safety highlighted by the Fukushima accident were assessed in the nuclear reactors in the EU\\\\\\'s member states, as well as those in any neighbouring states that decided to take part. These comprehensive and transparent nuclear risk and safety assessments, the so-called \"stress tests\", involved targeted reassessment of each power reactor’s safety margins in the light of extreme natural events, such as earthquakes and flooding, as well as on loss of safety functions and severe accident management following any initiating event. They were conducted from June 2011 to April 2012. They mobilized considerable expertise in different countries (500 man-years) under the responsibility of each national Safety Authority within the framework of the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG).The Western European Nuclear Regulators\\\\\\' Association (WENRA) proposed these in response to a call from the European Council in March 2011, and developed specifications. WENRA is a network of Chief Regulators of EU countries with nuclear power plants and Switzerland, and has membership from 17 countries. It then negotiated the scope of the tests with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), an independent, authoritative expert body created in 2007 by the European Commission comprising senior officials from the national nuclear safety, radioactive waste safety or radiation protection regulatory authorities from all EU member states, and representatives of the European Commission.In June 2011 the governments of seven non-EU countries agreed to conduct nuclear reactor stress tests using the EU model. Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine signed a declaration that they would conduct stress tests and agreed to peer reviews of the tests by outside experts. Russia had already undertaken extensive checks. (Croatia is co-owner in the Krsko PWR in Slovenia, and Turkey is building its first nuclear plant.)The reassessment of safety margins is based on the existing safety studies and engineering judgement to evaluate the behaviour of a nuclear power plant when facing a set of challenging situations. For a given plant, the reassessment reports on the most probable behaviour of the plant for each of the situations considered. The results of the reassessment were peer-reviewed and shared among regulators. WENRA noted that it remains a national responsibility to take or order any appropriate measures, such as additional technical or organizational safety provisions,\\\\xa0resulting from the reassessment.The scope of the assessment took into account the issues directly highlighted by the events in Fukushima and the possibility for combination of initiating events. Two \\\\\\'initiating events\\\\\\' were covered in the scope: earthquake and flooding. The consequences of these –\\\\xa0loss of electrical power and station blackout, loss of ultimate heat sink and the combination of both – were analysed, with the conclusions being applicable to other general emergency situations. In accident scenarios, regulators consider power plants\\\\\\' means to protect against and manage loss of core cooling as well as cooling of used fuel in storage. They also study means to protect against and manage loss of containment integrity and core melting, including consequential effects such as hydrogen accumulation.Nuclear plant operators start by documenting each power plant site. This analysis of \\\\\\'extreme scenarios\\\\\\' followed what ENSREG called a progressive approach \"in which protective measures are sequentially assumed to be defeated\" from starting conditions which \"represent the most unfavourable operational states.\" The operators have to explain their means to maintain \"the three fundamental safety functions (control of reactivity, fuel cooling confinement of radioactivity)\" and support functions for these, \"taking into account the probable damage done by the initiating event.\"The documents had to cover provisions in the plant design basis for these events and the strength of the plant beyond its design basis. This means the \"design margins, diversity, redundancy, structural protection and physical separation of the safety relevant systems, structures and components and the effectiveness of the defence-in-depth concept.\" This had to focus on \\\\\\'cliff-edge\\\\\\' effects, e.g. when back-up batteries are exhausted and station blackout is inevitable. For severe accident management scenarios they must identify the time before fuel damage is unavoidable and the time before water begins boiling in used fuel ponds and before fuel damage occurs. Measures to prevent hydrogen explosions and fires are to be part of this.Since the licensee has the prime responsibility for safety, they performed the reassessments, and the regulatory bodies then independently reviewed them. The exercise covered 147 nuclear plants in 15 EU countries – including Lithuania with only decommissioned plants – plus 15 reactors in Ukraine and five in Switzerland.Operators reported to their regulators who then reported progress to the European Commission by the end of 2011. Information was shared among regulators throughout this process before the 17 final reports went to peer-review by teams comprising 80 experts appointed by ENSREG and the European Commission. The final documents were published in line with national law and international obligations, subject only to not jeopardising security – an area where each country could behave differently. The process was extended to June 2012 to allow more plant visits and to add more information on the potential effect of aircraft impacts.The European Commission adopted, with ENSREG, the final stress tests Report on April 26, 2012 and issued the same day a joint statement underlining the quality of the exercise. The full report and a summary of the 45 recommendations were published on . Drawing on the peer reviews, the EC and ENSREG cited four main areas for improving EU nuclear plant safety:- Guidance from WENRA for assessing natural hazards and margins beyond design basis.- Giving more importance to periodic safety reviews and evaluation of natural hazards.- Urgent measures to protect containment integrity.- Measures to prevent and mitigate accidents resulting from extreme natural hazards.The results of the stress tests pointed out, in particular, that European nuclear power plants offered a sufficient safety level to require no shutdown of any of them. At the same time, improvements were needed to enhance their robustness to extreme situations. In France, for instance, they were imposed by ASN requirements, which took into account exchanges with its European counterparts. A follow-up European action plan was established by ENSREG from July 2012.The EU process was completed at the end of September 2012, with the EU Energy Commissioner announcing that the stress tests had showed that the safety of European power reactors was generally satisfactory, but making some other comments and projections which departed from ENSREG. An EC report was presented to the EU Council in October 2012.In the USA the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in March 2012 made orders for immediate post-Fukushima safety enhancements, with a cost of about $100 million across the whole US fleet. The first order required the addition of equipment at all plants to help respond to the loss of all electrical power and the loss of the ultimate heat sink for cooling, as well as maintaining containment integrity. Another required improved water level and temperature instrumentation on used fuel ponds. The third order applied only to the 33 BWRs with early containment designs, and required \\\\\\'reliable hardened containment vents\\\\\\' which work under any circumstances. The US industry association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the NRC that licensees with these Mark I and Mark II containments “should have the capability to use various filtration strategies to mitigate radiological releases” during severe events, and that filtration “should be founded on scientific and factual analysis and should be performance-based to achieve the desired outcome.” All the measures are supported by the industry association, which also proposed setting up about six regional emergency response centres under NRC oversight with additional portable equipment.In Japan similar stress tests were carried out in 2011 under the previous safety regulator, but then reactor restarts were delayed until the newly constituted Nuclear Regulatory Authority devised and published new safety guidelines, then applied them progressively through the fleet.## Natural disasters### Earthquakes and volcanoesThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a _Safety Guide on Seismic Risks for Nuclear Power Plants_, and the matter is dealt with in the WNA page on .\\\\xa0Volcanic hazards are minimal for practically all nuclear plants, but the IAEA has developed a new Safety Guide on the matter. The Bataan plant in Philippines which has never operated, and the Armenian plant at Metsamor are two known to be in proximity to potential volcanic activity.### Flooding –\\\\xa0storms, tides and tsunamisNuclear plants are usually built close to water bodies, for the sake of cooling. The site licence takes account of worst case flooding scenarios as well as other possible natural disasters and, more recently, the possible effects of climate change. As a result, all the buildings with safety-related equipment are situated on high enough platforms so that they stand above submerged areas in case of flooding events. As an example, French Safety Rules criteria for river sites define the safe level as above a flood level likely to be reached with one chance in one thousand years, plus 15%, and similar regarding tides for coastal sites.Occasionally in the past some buildings have been sited too low, so that they are vulnerable to flood or tidal and storm surge, so engineered countermeasures have been built. EDF\\\\\\'s Blayais nuclear plant in western France uses seawater for cooling and the plant itself is protected from storm surge by dykes. However, in 1999 a 2.5 m storm surge in the estuary overtopped the dykes – which were already identified as a weak point and scheduled for a later upgrade – and flooded one pumping station. For security reasons it was decided to shut down the three reactors then under power (the fourth was already stopped in the course of normal maintenance). This incident was rated 2 on the INES scale.In 1994 the Kakrapar nuclear power plant near the west coast of India was flooded due to heavy rains together with failure of weir control for an adjoining water pond, inundating turbine building basement equipment. The back-up diesel generators on site enabled core cooling using fire water, a backup to process water, since the offsite power supply failed. Following this, multiple flood barriers were provided at all entry points, inlet openings below design flood level were sealed and emergency operating procedures were updated. In December 2004 the Madras NPP and Kalpakkam PFBR site on the east coast of India was flooded by a tsunami surge from Sumatra. Construction of the Kalpakkam plant was just beginning, but the Madras plant shut down safely and maintained cooling. However, recommendations including early warning system for tsunami and provision of additional cooling water sources for longer duration cooling were implemented.In March 2011 the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was affected seriously by a huge tsunami induced by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Three of the six reactors were operating at the time, and had shut down automatically due to the earthquake. The back-up diesel generators for those three units were then swamped by the tsunami. This cut power supply and led to weeks of drama and loss of the reactors. The design basis tsunami height was 5.7 m for Daiichi (and 5.2 m for adjacent Daini, which was actually set a bit higher above sea level). Tsunami heights coming ashore were about 14 metres for both plants. Unit 3 of Daini was undamaged and continued to cold shutdown status, but the other units suffered flooding to pump rooms where equipment transfers heat from the reactor circuit to the sea – the ultimate heat sink.The maximum amplitude of this tsunami was 23 metres at point of origin, about 160 km from Fukushima. In the last century there had been eight tsunamis in the Japan region with maximum amplitudes above 10 metres (some much more), these having arisen from earthquakes of magnitude 7.7 to 8.4, on average one every 12 years. Those in 1983 and in 1993 were the most recent affecting Japan, with maximum heights 14.5 metres and 31 metres respectively, both induced by magnitude 7.7 earthquakes. This 2011 earthquake was magnitude 9.For low-lying sites, civil engineering and other measures are normally taken to make nuclear plants resistant to flooding. Lessons from Blayais and Fukushima have fed into regulatory criteria. Sea walls have been and are being built or increased at Hamaoka, Shimane, Mihama, Ohi, Takahama, Onagawa, and Higashidori plants. However, few parts of the world have the same tsunami potential as Japan, and for the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe the maximum amplitude is much less than Japan.## HydrogenIn any light-water nuclear power reactor, hydrogen is formed by radiolytic decomposition of water. This needs to be dealt with to avoid the potential for explosion with oxygen present, and many reactors have been retrofitted with passive autocatalytic hydrogen recombiners in their containment, replacing external recombiners that needed to be connected and powered, isolated behind radiological barriers. Also in some kinds of reactor, particularly early boiling water types, the containment is rendered inert by injection of nitrogen.In an accident situation such as at Fukushima where the fuel became very hot, a lot of hydrogen is formed by the oxidation of zirconium fuel cladding in steam at about 1300°C. This is beyond the capability of the normal hydrogen recombiners to deal with,\\\\xa0and operators must rely on venting to atmosphere or inerting the containment with nitrogen.## International collaboration to improve safetyThere is a lot of international collaboration, but it has evolved from the bottom, and only in 1990s has there been any real top-down initiative. In the aviation industry the Chicago Convention in the late 1940s initiated an international approach which brought about a high degree of design collaboration between countries, and the rapid universal uptake of lessons from accidents. There are cultural and political reasons for this which mean that even the much higher international safety collaboration since the 1990s is still less than in aviation. See also paper on\\\\xa0, especially for fuller description of WANO, focused on operation.#### World Association of Nuclear OperatorsInternational cooperation on nuclear safety issues takes place under the auspices of the World Association of Nuclear Operators ( ) which was set up in 1989. In practical terms this is the most effective international means of achieving very high levels of safety through its four major programs: peer reviews; operating experience; technical support and exchange; and professional and technical development. WANO peer reviews are the main proactive way of sharing experience and expertise, and by the end of 2009 every one of the world\\\\\\'s commercial nuclear power plants had been peer-reviewed at least once. Following the Fukushima accident these have been stepped up to one every four years at each plant, with follow-up visits in between, and the scope extended from operational safety to include plant design upgrades. Pre-startup reviews of new plants are being increased.#### IAEA Convention on Nuclear SafetyThe IAEA  (CNS) was drawn up during a series of expert level meetings from 1992 to 1994 and was the result of considerable work by Governments, national nuclear safety authorities and the IAEA Secretariat. Its aim is to legally commit participating States operating land-based nuclear power plants to maintain a high level of safety by setting international benchmarks to which States would subscribe.The obligations of the Parties are based to a large extent on the principles contained in the IAEA Safety Fundamentals document _The Safety of Nuclear Installations_. These obligations cover for instance, siting, design, construction, operation, the availability of adequate financial and human resources, the assessment and verification of safety, quality assurance and emergency preparedness.The Convention is an incentive instrument. It is not designed to ensure fulfilment of obligations by Parties through control and sanction, but is based on their common interest to achieve higher levels of safety. These levels are defined by international benchmarks developed and promoted through regular meetings of the Parties. The Convention obliges Parties to report on the implementation of their obligations for international peer review.\\\\xa0This mechanism is the main innovative and dynamic element of the Convention. \\\\xa0Under the Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) program dating from 1982 international teams of experts conduct in-depth reviews of operational safety performance at a nuclear power plant. They review emergency planning, safety culture, radiation protection, and other areas. OSART missions are on request from the government, and involve staff from regulators, in these respects differing from WANO peer reviews.The Convention entered into force in October 1996. As of March 2021, there were 91 signatories to the Convention, 65 of which are contracting parties, including all countries with operating nuclear power plants.The IAEA General Conference in September 2011 unanimously endorsed the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that Ministers requested in June. The plan arose from intensive consultations with Member States but not with industry, and was described as both a rallying point and a blueprint for strengthening nuclear safety worldwide. It contains suggestions to make nuclear safety more robust and effective than before, without removing the responsibility from national bodies and governments. It aims to ensure \"adequate responses based on scientific knowledge and full transparency\". Apart from strengthened and more frequent IAEA peer reviews (including those of regulatory systems), most of the 12 recommended actions are to be undertaken by individual countries and are likely to be well in hand already.Following this, an extraordinary general meeting of 64 of the CNS parties in September 2012 gave a strong push to international collaboration in improving safety. National reports at future three-yearly CNS review meetings will cover a list of specific design, operational and organizational issues stemming from Fukushima lessons. They include further design features to avoid long-term offsite contamination and enhancement of emergency preparedness and response measures, including better definition of national responsibilities and improved international cooperation. Parties should also report on measures to \"ensure the effective independence of the regulatory body from undue influence.\"In February 2015 diplomats from 72 countries unanimously adopted the\\\\xa0, setting out “principles to guide them, as appropriate, in the implementation of the objective of the CNS to prevent accidents with radiological consequences and mitigate such consequences should they occur” but rejected Swiss amendments to the CNS as impractical. However, in line with Swiss and EU intentions, \"comprehensive and systematic safety assessments are to be carried out periodically and regularly for existing installations throughout their lifetime in order to identify safety improvements... Reasonably practicable or achievable safety improvements are to be implemented in a timely manner.\"#### IAEA design safety reviews and generic reactor safety reviewsAn IAEA design safety review (DSR) is performed at the request of a member state organization to evaluate the completeness and comprehensiveness of a reactor\\\\\\'s safety documentation by an international team of senior experts. It is based on IAEA published safety requirements. If the DSR is for a vendor’s design at the pre-licensing stage, it is done using the generic reactor safety review (GRSR) module. IAEA Safety Standards, applied in the DSR and GRSR at the fundamental and requirements level, are generic and apply to all nuclear installations. Therefore, it is neither intended nor possible to cover or substitute licensing activity, or to constitute any kind of design certification.DSRs have been undertaken in Armenia (2003, 2009), Bangladesh (2018), Bulgaria (2008), Pakistan (2006) and Ukraine (2008, 2009). GRSRs have been carried out on ACP100, ACP1000, ACPR-1000+, ACR1000, AES-2006, AP1000 (USA & UK), APR1000, APR1400, Atmea1, CAP1400, EPR, ESBWR, and VVER-TOI.#### Eastern Europe from 1980sIn relation to Eastern Europe particularly, since the late 1980s a major international program of assistance was carried out by the OECD, IAEA and Commission of the European Communities to bring early Soviet-designed reactors up to near western safety standards, or at least to effect significant improvements to the plants and their operation. The European Union also brought pressure to bear, particularly in countries which aspired to EU membership.Modifications were made to overcome deficiencies in the 11  still operating at the time in Russia. Among other things, these removed the danger of a positive void coefficient response. Automated inspection equipment has also been installed in these reactors.The other class of reactors which has been the focus of international attention for safety upgrades is the first-generation of pressurized water VVER-440 reactors. The V-230 model was designed before formal safety standards were issued in the Soviet Union and they lack many basic safety features. Two are still operating in Russia and one in Armenia, under close inspection.Later Soviet-designed reactors are very much safer and have Western control systems or the equivalent, along with containment structures.#### Europe since 1999The main European safety collaboration is through the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group ( ), an independent, authoritative expert body created in 2007 by the European Commission to revive the EU nuclear safety directive, which was passed in June 2009. It comprises senior officials from the national nuclear safety, radioactive waste safety or radiation protection regulatory authorities from all 27 EU member states, and representatives of the European Commission. It was preceded in 1999 by the Western European Nuclear Regulators\\\\\\' Association ( ), a network of Chief Regulators of EU countries with nuclear power plants and Switzerland, with membership from 17 countries.## Ageing of nuclear plants#### EngineeringSeveral issues arise in prolonging the lives of nuclear plants which were originally designed for nominal 30- or 40-year operating lives. Systems, structures and components (SSC) whose characteristics change gradually with time or use are the subject of attention, which is applied with vastly greater scientific and technical knowledge than that available to the original designers many decades ago.Some components simply wear out, corrode\\\\xa0or degrade to a low level of efficiency. These need to be replaced. Steam generators are the most prominent and expensive of these, and many have been replaced after about 30 years where the reactor otherwise has the prospect of running for 60 years. This is essentially an economic decision. Lesser components are more straightforward to replace as they age, and some may be safety-related as well as economic.In PHWR units, notably CANDU reactors, pressure tube replacement has been undertaken on some older plants, after some 30 years of operation.\\\\xa0Fuel channel integrity is another limiting factor for Candu reactors, and mid-life inspection and analysis can extend the original 175,000 full-power operating hours design assumption to 300,000 hours.A second issue is that of obsolescence. For instance, older reactors have analogue instrument and control systems, and a question must be faced regarding whether these are replaced with digital in a major mid-life overhaul, or simply maintained.Thirdly, the properties of materials may degrade with age, particularly with heat and neutron irradiation. In some early Russian pressurized water reactors, the pressure vessel is relatively narrow and is thus subject to greater neutron bombardment that a wider one. This raises questions of embrittlement, and has had to be checked carefully before extending licences.In some Russian and UK plants (RBMK, AGR), graphite is used as the moderator. The graphite blocks cannot be replaced during the operating life of the reactors. However, radiation damage changes the shape and size of the crystallites that comprise graphite, giving some dimensional change and degradation of the structural properties of the graphite. For continued operation, it is therefore necessary to demonstrate that the graphite can still perform its intended role irrespective of the degradation, or undergo some repair. In Russia, after dismantling the pressure tubes, longitudinal cutting of a limited number of deformed graphite columns returns the graphite stack geometry to a condition that meets the initial design requirements. Leningrad 1 was the first RBMK reactor to undergo this over 2012-13.In respect to all these aspects, periodic safety reviews are undertaken on most older plants in line with the IAEA safety convention and WANO\\\\\\'s safety culture principles to ensure that safety margins are maintained.\\\\xa0The IAEA undertakes Safety Aspects of Long-Term Operation (SALTO) evaluations of reactors on request from member countries. These SALTO missions check both physical and organizational aspects, and function as an international peer review of the national regulator.\\\\xa0They are backed up by the IAEA International Generic Ageing Lessons Learned (IGALL) program which is documented in databases and publications, in the form of downloadable safety guides and reports on ageing.Equipment performance is constantly monitored to identify faults and failures of components. Preventative maintenance is adapted and scheduled in the light of this, to ensure that the overall availability of systems important for both safety and plant availability are within the design basis, or better than the original design basis. Collecting reliability and performance data is of the utmost importance, as well as analysing them, for tracking indicators that might be signs of ageing, or indicative of potential problems having been under-estimated, or of new problems. The results of this monitoring and analysis are often shared Industry-wide through INPO and WANO networks. The use of probabilistic safety analysis makes possible risk-informed decisions regarding maintenance and monitoring programs, so that adequate attention is given to the health of every piece of equipment in the plant. This process is similar to that in other industries where safety is paramount, _e.g._ aviation. Reliability centred maintenance was adapted from civil aviation in the 1980s for instance, and led to nuclear industry review of existing maintenance programmes.In the USA most of the about 95 reactors are expected to be granted operating licence extensions from 40 to 60 years, with many to 80 years. This justifies significant capital expenditure in upgrading systems and components, including building in extra performance margins.#### Knowledge managementThe IAEA has a safety knowledge base for ageing and long-term operation of nuclear power plants (SKALTO) which aims to develop a framework for sharing information on ageing management and long term operation of nuclear power plants. It provides published documents and information related to this.Knowledge management in relation to the original design basis of reactors becomes an issue with corporate reorganization or demise of vendors, coupled with changes made over several decades. While operators usually have good records, some regulators do not. Design Basis Knowledge Management (DKM) is an issue receiving a lot of attention in the last ten years or so.Nuclear DKM addresses the specific needs of nuclear plants and organizations. Its scope extends from research and development, through design and engineering, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, refurbishment and long-term operation (LTO), waste management, to decommissioning. Nuclear DKM issues and priorities are often unique to the particular circumstances of individual countries and their regulators as well as other nuclear industry organizations. Nuclear DKM may focus on knowledge creation, identification, sharing, transfer, protection, validation, storage, dissemination, preservation or utilization. Nuclear DKM practices may enhance and support traditional business functions and goals such as human resource management, training, planning, operations, maintenance, and much more.There must always be a responsible owner of the DKM system for any plant. In most cases this will be the operator, however, based on a variety of changes such as market conditions, the responsible owner may change over time. An effective nuclear DKM system should be focused on strengthening and aligning the knowledge base in three primary knowledge domains in an organization: people, processes and technology, each of which must also be considered within the context of the organizational culture. Knowledge management policies and practices should help create a supportive organizational culture that recognizes the value of nuclear knowledge and promotes effective processes to maintain it.In Canada, the Pickering A – Bruce A saga is a cautionary tale (and classic industry case study) regarding DKM. By the mid-1990s there was a divergence between drawings and modifications which had progressively been made, and also the operating company had not shared operating experience with the designer. Maintenance standards fell and costs rose. A detailed audit in 1997-98 showed that the design basis was not being maintained and that 4000 additional staff would be required to correct the situation at all Ontario Hydro plants, so the two A plants (eight units) were shut down so that staff could focus on the 12 units not needing so much attention. From 2003, six of the eight A units were returned to service with design basis corrected, having been shut down for several years – a significant loss of asset base for the owners.## Reporting nuclear incidentsThe  (INES) was developed by the IAEA and OECD in 1990 to communicate and standardize the reporting of nuclear incidents or accidents to the public. The scale runs from a zero event with no safety significance to 7 for a \"major accident\" such as Chernobyl. TMI rated 5, as an \"accident with off-site risks\" though no harm to anyone, and a level 4 \"accident mainly in installation\" occurred in France in 1980, with little drama. Another accident rated at level 4 occurred in a  in Japan in September 1999.\\\\xa0 Other accidents have been in military plants .**The International Nuclear Event Scale**For prompt communication of safety significance| Level, Descriptor | Off-Site Impact, release of radioactive materials | On-Site Impact | Defence-in-Depth Degradation | Examples || --- | --- | --- | --- | --- || **7**<br>**Major Accident** | Major Release:<br> Widespread health and environmental effects |  |  | Chernobyl, Ukraine, 1986 (fuel meltdown and fire);\\\\xa0<br> Fukushima Daiichi 1-3, 2011 (fuel damage, radiation release and evacuation) || **6**<br>**Serious Accident** | Significant Release:<br> Full implementation of local emergency plans |  |  | Mayak at Ozersk, Russia, 1957 \\\\\\'Kyshtym\\\\\\' (reprocessing plant criticality) || **5**<br>**Accident with Off-Site Consequences** | Limited Release:<br> Partial implementation of local emergency plans, or | Severe damage to reactor core or to radiological barriers |  | Three Mile Island, USA, 1979 (fuel melting);<br> Windscale, UK, 1957 (military) || **4**<br>**Accident Mainly in Installation, with local consequences.**<br> either of: | Minor Release:<br> Public exposure of the order of prescribed limits, or | Significant damage to reactor core or to radiological barriers; worker fatality |  | Saint-Laurent A1, France, 1969 (fuel rupture) & A2 1980 (graphite overheating);<br> Tokai-mura, Japan, 1999 (criticality in fuel plant for an experimental reactor). || **3**<br>**Serious Incident**<br> any of: | Very Small Release:<br> Public exposure at a fraction of prescribed limits, or | Major contamination; Acute health effects to a worker, or | Near Accident:<br> Loss of Defence in Depth provisions - no safety layers remaining | Fukushima Daiichi 4, 2011 (fuel pond overheating);<br> Fukushima Daini 1, 2, 4, 2011 (interruption to cooling);\\\\xa0<br> Vandellos, Spain, 1989 (turbine fire);\\\\xa0<br> Davis-Besse, USA, 2002 (severe corrosion);<br> Paks, Hungary 2003 (fuel damage) || **2**<br>**Incident** | nil | Significant spread of contamination; Overexposure of worker, or | Incidents with significant failures in safety provisions |  || **1**<br>**Anomaly** | nil | nil | Anomaly beyond authorized operating regime |  || **0**<br>**Deviation** | nil | nil | No safety significance |  || Below Scale | nil | nil | No safety relevance |  |Source: International Atomic Energy Agency## Security – terrorism, etc.See also information page on .Since the World Trade Centre attacks in New York in 2001 there has been increased concern about the consequences of a large aircraft being used to attack a nuclear facility with the purpose of releasing radioactive materials. Various studies have looked at similar attacks on nuclear power plants. They show that nuclear reactors would be more resistant to such attacks than virtually any other civil installations – see\\\\xa0 A\\\\xa0\\\\xa0thorough study was undertaken by the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) using specialist consultants and paid for by the US Dept. of Energy. It concludes that US reactor structures \"are robust and (would) protect the fuel from impacts of large commercial aircraft\".The analyses used a fully-fuelled Boeing 767-400 of over 200 tonnes as the basis, at 560 km/h – the maximum speed for precision flying near the ground. The wingspan is greater than the diameter of reactor containment buildings and the 4.3 tonne engines are 15 metres apart. Hence analyses focused on single engine direct impact on the centreline – since this would be the most penetrating missile – and on the impact of the entire aircraft if the fuselage hit the centreline (in which case the engines would ricochet off the sides). In each case no part of the aircraft or its fuel would penetrate the containment. Other studies have confirmed these findings.Penetrating (even relatively weak) reinforced concrete requires multiple hits by high speed artillery shells or specially-designed \"bunker busting\" ordnance – both of which are well beyond what terrorists are likely to deploy. Thin-walled, slow-moving, hollow aluminium aircraft, hitting containment-grade heavily-reinforced concrete disintegrate, with negligible penetration. But further (see Sept 2002 _Science_ paper and Jan 2003 Response & Comments), realistic assessments from decades of analyses, lab work and testing, find that the consequence of even the worst realistic scenarios – core melting and containment failure – can cause few if any deaths to the public, regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment failure. This conclusion was documented in a 1981 EPRI study, reported and widely circulated in many languages, by Levenson and Rahn in _Nuclear Technology_.In 1988 Sandia National Laboratories in USA demonstrated the unequal distribution of energy absorption that occurs when an aircraft impacts a massive, hardened target. The test involved a rocket-propelled F4 Phantom jet (about 27 tonnes, with both engines close together in the fuselage) hitting a 3.7m thick slab of concrete at 765 km/h. This was to see whether a proposed Japanese nuclear power plant could withstand the impact of a heavy aircraft. It showed how most of the collision energy goes into the destruction of the aircraft itself – about 96% of the aircraft\\\\\\'s kinetic energy went into the its destruction and some penetration of the concrete – while the remaining 4% was dissipated in accelerating the 700-tonne slab. The maximum penetration of the concrete in this experiment was 60 mm, but comparison with fixed reactor containment needs to take account of the 4% of energy transmitted to the slab. See also .As long ago as the late 1970s, the UK Central Electricity Generating Board considered the possibility of a fully-laden and fully-fuelled large passenger aircraft being hijacked and deliberately crashed into a nuclear reactor. The main conclusions were that an airliner would tend to break up as it hit various buildings such as the reactor hall, and that those pieces would have little effect on the concrete biological shield surrounding the reactor. Any kerosene fire would also have little effect on that shield.\\\\xa0In the 1980s in the USA, at least some plants were designed to take a hit from a fully-laden large military transport aircraft and still be able to achieve and maintain cold shutdown.The study of a 1970s US power plant in a highly-populated area is assessing the possible effects of a successful terrorist attack which causes both meltdown of the core and a large breach in the containment structure – both extremely unlikely. It shows that a large fraction of the most hazardous radioactive isotopes, like those of iodine and tellurium, would never leave the site.Much of the radioactive material would stick to surfaces inside the containment or becomes soluble salts that remain in the damaged containment building. Some radioactive material would nonetheless enter the environment some hours after the attack in this extreme scenario and affect areas up to several kilometres away. The extent and timing of this means that with walking-pace evacuation inside this radius it would not be a major health risk. However it could leave areas contaminated and hence displace people in the same way as a natural disaster, giving rise to economic rather than health consequences.Looking at spent fuel storage pools, similar analyses showed no breach. Dry storage and transport casks retained their integrity. \"There would be no release of radionuclides to the environment\".Similarly, the massive structures mean that any terrorist attack even inside a plant (which are well defended) and causing loss of cooling, core melting and breach of containment would not result in any significant radioactive releases.However, while the main structures are robust, the 2001 attacks did lead to increased security requirements and plants were required by NRC to install barriers, bulletproof security stations and other physical modifications which in the USA are estimated by the industry association to have cost some $2 billion across the country.See also  2002 and .Switzerland\\\\\\'s Nuclear Safety Inspectorate studied a similar scenario and reported in 2003 that the danger of any radiation release from such a crash would be low for the older plants and extremely low for the newer ones.The conservative design criteria which caused most power reactors to be shrouded by massive containment structures with biological shield has provided peace of mind in a suicide terrorist context. Ironically and as noted earlier, with better understanding of what happens in a core melt accident inside, they are now seen to be not nearly as necessary in that accident mitigation role as was originally assumed.## Advanced reactor designsThe designs for nuclear plants being developed for implementation in coming decades contain numerous safety improvements based on operational experience. The first two of these\\\\xa0 began operating in Japan in 1996.One major feature they have in common (beyond safety engineering already standard in Western reactors) is passive safety systems, requiring no operator intervention in the event of a major malfunction.The main metric used to assess reactor safety is the likelihood of the core melting due to loss of coolant. These new designs are one or two orders of magnitude less likely than older ones to suffer a core melt accident, but the significance of that is more for the owner and operator than the neighbours, who –\\\\xa0as TMI and Fukushima showed – are safe also with older types.## Safety relative to other energy sourcesMany occupational accident statistics have been generated over the last 40 years of nuclear reactor operations in the US and UK. These can be compared with those from coal-fired power generation. All show that nuclear is a distinctly safer way to produce electricity.**Deaths from energy-related accidents per unit of electricity**![]( TW.yr is the amount of electricity used by the world in about five months.Coal-fired power generation has chronic, rather than acute, safety implications for public health. It also has profound safety implications for the mining of coal, with hundreds of workers killed each year in coal mines (see Appendix).Hydro power generation has a record of few but very major events causing thousands of deaths. In 1975 when the Banqiao, Shimantan & other dams collapsed in Henan, China, at least 30,000 people were killed immediately and some 230,000 overall, with 18 GWe lost. In 1979 and 1980 in India some 3500 were killed by two hydro-electric dam failures, and in 2009 in Russia 75 were killed by a hydro power plant turbine disintegration.\\\\xa0Early in 2017 nearly 200,000 people were evacuated due to the potential failure of the Oroville Dam in California.Significant energy-related accidents are quoted in the\\\\xa0. \\\\xa0A major reason for coal\\\\\\'s unfavourable showing is the huge amount which must be mined and transported to supply even a single large power station. Mining and multiple handling of so much material of any kind involves hazards, and these are reflected in the statistics.In the UK, Friends of the Earth commissioned a study by the Tyndall Centre, which drew primarily on peer-reviewed academic literature, supplemented by literature from credible government, consultancy and policy sources. It concluded in January 2013 that “Overall the safety risks associated with nuclear power appear to be more in line with lifecycle impacts from renewable energy technologies, and significantly lower than for coal and natural gas per MWh of supplied energy.”* * *## Notes & references#### General sourcesBall, Roberts & Simpson, Research Report #20, Centre for Environmental & Risk Management, University of East Anglia, 1994IAEA 2005, Chernobyl Forum report: Chernobyl\\\\\\'s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic ImpactsIAEA 1997, Sustainable Development and Nuclear PowerPaul Scherrer Institut 2001, Severe Accidents in the Energy SectorTwilley R C, Framatome ANP\\\\\\'s SWR1000 reactor design, Nuclear News, Sept 2002EPRI Dec 2002 report Deterring Terrorism: Aircraft Crash Impact Analyses Demonstrate Nuclear Power Plant\\\\\\'s Structural Strength on NEI websiteChapin D.M., Levenson M., Pate Z.P., Rockwell T et al 2002, Nuclear Power Plants and their Fuel as terrorist Targets, Science, Sept 2002; with Letters & Response, Science 10 Jan 2003Levenson, M. & Rahn, F. 1981, Realistic Estimates of the Consequences of Nuclear Accidents, Nuclear Technology 53:99-110, ANS, May 1981Stoiber, Carl 2007, World Nuclear University Summer InstituteOECD Nuclear Energy Agency 2010, Comparing Nuclear Accident Risks with those from other energy sources.

Many Member States that are considering embarking on a nuclear power programme or on a first research reactor project face difficulties in allocating resources for regulatory capacity building. The Integrated Regulatory Review Service, the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR)1 and other peer review and advisory services undertaken in embarking countries continue to identify the need to strengthen regulatory body independence, build regulatory capacity and competence, and establish safety regulations and licensing processes as part of effective legislative and regulatory oversight programmes.![]( The Agency will:General Safety·Strengthen its safety standardsand assist withtheir application;·Promoteadherenceto Conventionsunder itsauspicesand supporttheir implementation;·AssistMemberStatesinstrengtheningtheirregulatoryeffectiveness;·AssistMember States in strengthening leadershipandmanagementfor safety;·AssistMember States instrengtheningtheir processesforcommunicating radiation risks;·AssistMemberStates intheir capacitybuildingprogrammes;and·AssistMemberStates\\'effortsinthefield of researchand developmentfor safety.7. There is continued Member State interest in building and further developing their national systems for EPR, including risk assessment, the use of dose projection tools, and effective communication. Member States continue to seek Agency support in improving the preparation, conduct and evaluation of national emergency exercises.8. In 2022, the number of Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management increased by two, while there was no increase in the number of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS).9. In 2022, one further Member State2 became Party to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident (Early Notification Convention), while three further Member States3 became Parties to the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Assistance Convention). By the end of 2022, 40 States Parties to the Assistance Convention had registered National Assistance Capabilities in the Agency’s Response and Assistance Network, of which three States Parties4 to the Assistance Convention registered National Assistance Capabilities this year.![]( andResponse# The Agency will:·Furtherdevelopandsupportthe implementationoftheoperational arrangementsfornotification,reportingand assistance; ·AssistMemberStates inthe implementationof IAEA Safety StandardsSeries No.GSRPart7anddevelopassociated Safety Guides;and ·Continue to implement an active exercise programmeatthe international level totest EPRand supportnational EPRexercise programmes.10. There is growing Member State interest in the identification and characterization of areas contaminated by past activities or events and in planning for remediation and post-remediation management of sites. There is also Member State interest in sharing experiences of successful remediation projects. Member States continue to request Agency assistance in remediation activities.11. International attention continues to be paid to the handling of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP).12. There is increasing interest in Member States in the recording and analysis of the radiological impact on people and the environment from regulated discharges from facilities and activities and due to residual radioactive materials that derives from past unregulated practices or abnormal situations. Agency programmes — such as the Database on Discharges of Radionuclides to the Atmosphere and Aquatic Environment for discharges and the Methods for Radiological and Environmental Impact Assessment programme for exchanging experience regarding radiological assessment methodologies — are responding to this interest.13. Access to and use of diagnostic imaging procedures utilizing ionizing radiation is growing, leading to higher cumulative individual exposures in Member States and creating a need for greater awareness of the importance of justification of medical exposures and optimization of radiation protection of patients.14. The intensive use of radioactive sources in medicine, agriculture, industry and research has led to a growing number of disused radioactive sources that require safe and secure management and disposal. Member States require further guidance on the application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources with regard to ensuring financial provisions for the safe management and secure protection of disused radioactive sources. The number of Member States committed to acting in a harmonized manner with the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources is 128, and the number of States that have committed themselves to implementing the supplementary Guidance on the Management of Disused Radioactive Sources grew to 50 in 2022.15. The need for capacity in Member States for the release of material and waste from regulatory control has increased. Requests continue for Agency support for safe interim and long term management solutions for radioactive waste. Disposal is the safe long term management solution for waste. The Agency’s Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management, Decommissioning and Remediation peer review service continues to be in demand.![]( The Agency will:Strengthening Radiation,Transprt and Waste Safety·AssistMember Statesinthe management of radioactive sources;·Promote the application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security ofRadioactive Sourcesandthe supplementary Guidance on the Importand Exportof Radioactive Sourcesand Guidanceonthe Management of Disused RadioactiveSources;·AssistMemberStatesindevelopingand implementingnational policiesand strategies forthe safemanagementofradioactivewasteand spentfuel, including disposal,andthedevelopment of decommissioning strategiesand plans;·Promoteand facilitate the sharing of experience regarding the remediationof contaminatedareasand;·Conduct technical reviews,upon request,of Member State activities.16. Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) mission reports continue to identify recommendations and suggestions with regard to strengthening the conduct of safe operations, enhancing continuous improvement, optimizing maintenance activities, strengthening accident management and on-site EPR, and setting, communicating and implementing management expectations.17. Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation (SALTO) missions continue to identify the need to improve the preparedness of NPPs for long term operation (LTO), specifically in the areas of safety assessments, including ageing management, knowledge management and competence management. Member States are increasingly using periodic safety reviews to justify the LTO of NPPs and have expressed interest in sharing current challenges, good practices and examples of corrective actions and resultant safety improvements.18. Member States are continuing to request Site and External Events Design (SEED) missions, as well as other capacity building services related to this subject.19. Member States continue to revise severe accident management guidance for existing NPPs to include safety upgrades and non-permanent equipment, and to address multi-unit considerations.20. The application of Agency safety standards to innovative NPP designs, including small modular reactors (SMRs), is a matter of great interest for Member States. The construction and deployment of transportable NPPs (TNPPs) is also of increasing interest to Member States.21. More than 80 different designs of SMR are at various stages of development and some SMR concepts are close to deployment. Several Member States are considering requesting Technical Safety Review (TSR) services for SMR designs.22. In response to the growing interest of Member States in the utilization of advanced new reactor technologies, the Agency developed the IAEA Platform on Small Modular Reactors and their Applications (SMR Platform). In addition, the Agency launched the Nuclear Harmonization and Standardization Initiative (NHSI), which reflects Member States’ interest in the harmonization of safety requirements and regulatory and licensing approaches as well as in the standardization of industrial approaches for SMRs. Furthermore, some Member States expressed an interest in applying a holistic approach to safety–security–safeguards by design for nuclear installations, in particular for SMRs, in the early stage of the design process without prejudice to Member States’ legal commitments, the Agency’s Statute and the relevant General Conference resolutions.23. Most Member States with operating research reactors are applying the provisions of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors.24. Analysis of reports provided to the Fuel Incident Notification and Analysis System (FINAS) in 2022 showed the importance of establishing effective ageing management programmes, continued training of personnel, and effective use of operating procedures.![]( SafetyinNuclear Installations# TheAgency will:·AssistMember States in implementing programmes forageing management andthe longtermoperation;·Facilitate the exchange of operating experience;·Provide assistance to Member Statesto supporttheir preparation for implementationofsafetyupgrades;·AssistMemberStateactivitiesrelatedtosmallandmediumsizedormodular reactors;·Strengthentheapplication of the Code of Conductonthe Safety of Research Reactors;and·AssistMember Statesinthe development of safety infrastructures fornew nuclearpowerand research reactorprogrammes.25.

The Agency will continue strengthening its safety standards using lessons from international conferences and other relevant sources. The Agency will assist with the application of its safety standards by, inter alia, strengthening its peer review and advisory services and related selfassessment tools. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Further optimize the process for the development of safety standards, including improving the operational website used by the Safety Standards Committees and the Commission on Safety Standards, and consolidate the long term strategy for their future development;Review the safety standards for their applicability to small and medium sized or modular reactors (SMRs) and larger non-water cooled reactors and update them accordingly;Continue encouraging Member States to request Agency peer review and advisory services to strengthen their operational safety performance and leadership and management for safety; Continue providing Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) missions according to the recommended ten-year cycle, including IRRS follow-up missions, and continue encouraging Member States to request these missions;Encourage Member States to request Technical Safety Review (TSR) services concerning the safety of conceptual reactor designs for SMRs to increase confidence in the safety of their designs or the adequacy of their safety assessments, as well as to identify the path to implement practicable improvements to nuclear safety;Continue strengthening Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) missions by extending the pool of experts serving as reviewers, facilitating the self-assessment process using the Emergency Preparedness and Response Information Management System (EPRIMS), increasing transparency of findings, and making consistent use of performance indicators to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of missions; andContinue encouraging Member States to request Occupational Radiation Protection Appraisal Service (ORPAS) missions to strengthen their legislative and regulatory infrastructure and their practical implementation of occupational radiation protection programmes.# A.2. International Safety Conventions# Trends4. The Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) was adopted on 17 June 1994 and entered into force on 24 October 1996. As of December 2022, there were 91 Contracting Parties to the CNS (see Figure 2).![]( 2. Number of Contracting Parties to the CNS between 2018 and 2022.5. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (Joint Convention) was adopted on 5 September 1997 and entered into force on 18 June 2001. As of December 2022, there were 88 Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention, an increase of 2 compared to the end of 2021 (see Figure 3).![]( 3. Number of Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention between 2018 and 2022.6. The Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident (Early Notification Convention) was adopted on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 27 October 1986. As of December 2022, there were 132 States Parties to the Early Notification Convention, an increase of 1 compared to the end of 2021.7. The Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Assistance Convention) was adopted on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 26 February 1987. As of December 2022, there were 127 States Parties to the Assistance Convention, an increase of 3 compared to the end of 2021.# Related Activities8. The Agency will promote universal adherence to the CNS, Joint Convention, Early Notification Convention and Assistance Convention, and support their effective implementation, inter alia through the organization of workshops at the regional level and through bilateral activities with the Member States. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Organize the Joint Eighth and Ninth Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the CNS;Continue promoting the adherence of Member States to international safety conventions; Provide educational workshops for Contracting Parties to ensure effective implementation of the CNS;Organize regional and interregional workshops to promote the adherence of Member States to the Joint Convention; andImplement the actions adopted at the 11th Meeting of the Representatives of Competent Authorities Identified under the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention, which aim to strengthen emergency preparedness and response (EPR) in Member States.# A.3. Regulatory Effectiveness in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport and Waste Safety, and in Emergency Preparedness and Response# Trends9. Information provided in the Agency’s Radiation Safety Information Management System (RASIMS)5 indicates that $80 %$ of Member States whose information in the system has been evaluated have a regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety with a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘good’ level of compliance with Agency safety standards.10. The 13 IRRS missions conducted in 2022 highlighted the continued commitment of the Member States concerned to strengthening national legal and governmental infrastructure. The Agency’s ongoing analysis of IRRS missions conducted since 2015 shows that many regulatory bodies still experience issues with maintaining regulations for occupational and medical exposure; reviewing and testing emergency plans; long term human resource planning; financial resources; management systems; and the implementation of a graded approach to regulatory processes, including authorization and inspection.11. There is increasing interest from Member States in the assessment of their radioactive waste and spent fuel management, decommissioning and remediation programmes, as demonstrated by the number of requests for Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management, Decommissioning and Remediation (ARTEMIS) missions. Ten ARTEMIS missions were conducted in 2022 and nine are planned for 2023 concerning Member States’ radioactive waste management programmes.12. Member States are showing increasing interest in performing self-assessments against the requirements of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 7 (Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency), using EPRIMS. Data indicates that $1 5 %$ of Member States conducted or updated one of their self-assessments against GSR Part 7 in 2022.13. Member States, at the Transport Safety Standards Committee, concluded their review of the 2018 edition of the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR-6 (Rev. 1)) and requested the Secretariat to initiate its revision.# GC(67)/INF/2Page 14# There is...![]( commitmentto strengthening national legaland governmental infrastructure;·Continued interestamongmanyMemberStatesinupdatingnational EPRframeworks,including EPR regulations,and harmonizing national arrangements;and·Continuedinterestin ARTEMiSmissions.RegulatoryEffectiveness inNuclear,RadiationTransportandWaste Safety, andinEmergencyPreparednessandResponse# There are...Issuesinrelationtolongtermhumanresourceplans,themanagementsystem andthe implementationofthe gradedapproachwithinregulatoryprocesses.# Need for...·Training forRPOsand qualifiedexperts,and extension ofthemonitoringscopeof technical serviceproviderstostrengthenoccupational radiation protection;and ·Discussionof the effectiveness of nuclearand radiationregulatory systems atanInternational ConferenceonEffective Nuclearand RadiationRegulatory Systems:PreparingfortheFutureinaRapidlyChangingEnvironment.# Related Activities14.

The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Organize the International Conference on Effective Nuclear and Radiation Regulatory Systems: Preparing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Environment, the sixth in a series of conferences on effective nuclear and radiation regulatory systems; andOrganize workshops on the lessons identified from IRRS missions.# A.4. Leadership and Management for Safety, Safety Culture and Communication on Safety# Trends15. Member States’ interest in the Agency’s regional networks and thematic networks under the Global Nuclear Safety and Security Network (GNSSN) framework continues to increase. 16. Agency peer review and advisory service mission reports continue to include recommendations relating to leadership, safety management, occupational radiation protection and safety culture. 17. The number of requests from Member States for assistance in conducting safety culture selfassessments for regulatory bodies remains high. The number of requests for the International School of Nuclear and Radiological Leadership for Safety also remains high. 18. Thematic working groups and Technical Meetings have highlighted the need for the Secretariat to further support Member States in developing communication strategies and plans.·Reviewandadvisory servicemissionreportscontinuetoinclude recommendationsrelatingtoleadership,safetymanagement,occupational radiationprotectionandsafetyculture;and·MemberStatescontinuetorequestassistance indeveloping their programmes onleadershipandsafetymanagement.![]( Need for...·TheSecretariattofurther supportMemberStatesindevelopingcommunication strategiesandplans;and ·Supportforknowledgenetworkingactivitiesunderthe GNSSN.# Related Activities19. The Agency will assist Member States in strengthening leadership and management for the safety of nuclear and radiation facilities and activities. The Agency will assist Member States in their efforts to foster and sustain a strong safety culture. The Agency will also assist Member States in strengthening their processes for communicating radiation risks to the public in planned and existing exposure situations and during an emergency. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Hold a Technical Meeting on Experience in Development of Leadership and Safety Culture Programmes in Member States;Hold a training course on Leadership, Management and Culture for Safety and on the Safety Culture Continuous Improvement Process; andContinue to implement the International Schools of Nuclear and Radiological Leadership for Safety.# A.5. Capacity Building in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport and Waste Safety, and in Emergency Preparedness and Response# Trends20. Member States continue to express a need for Agency support as they develop and strengthen their national provisions for education, training, qualification and competence in radiation protection, in order to achieve closer alignment with Agency safety standards.21. Member States have provided information on the current status of their national provisions in order to identify areas where these should be strengthened and they have evaluated the education and training needs at the national level, particularly for personnel with responsibilities for radiation protection and safety (radiation protection officers (RPOs) and qualified experts).22. The Postgraduate Educational Course (PGEC) in Radiation Protection and the Safety of Radiation Sources continued to be an effective programme through which Member States can train personnel with regulatory or advisory functions in radiation safety. An increasing number of Member States are showing interest in hosting the course, under the auspices of the Agency, for the benefit of other Member States at the regional level.# GC(67)/INF/2Page 16PostgraduateEducational Course(PGEC) in RadiationProtection and theSafety of Radiation SourcesFirstheld:1981 in ArgentinaObjective:Toprovidea soundbasis inradiationprotectionandthesafety ofradiationsources.Includesboththeoreticaland practicaltrainingon themultidisciplinaryscientificandtechnicalfoundationsofinternational recommendationsandstandardsonradiationprotectionandtheir implementation.Number ofparticipants since 1981:2067Moreinformation: 600 hours 10 Regional 5 UN languages distributed Training plus over20weeks Centres Portuguese23. In general, Member States’ interest in online and web-based training on radiation protection — including radiation protection in medical uses of ionizing radiation, occupational radiation protection, radon, transport and waste safety — which had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions of previous years, has remained high. Member States are also showing increasing interest in accessing e-learning resources on Agency safety standards and on their practical application, as well as in participating in knowledge management networks where they can share their experience of the application of the safety standards in national and international projects.24. Reports provided by Member States to the Steering Committee on Regulatory Capacity Building and Knowledge Management show the timely implementation of the strategic approach to capacity building in nuclear safety. The work programme of the Steering Committee and the activities of the Secretariat remain on track.25. There was an increase in the number of requests for support for education and training activities related to site evaluation and operational safety performance of nuclear installations, in particular SMRs, design safety and safety assessment, protection against external events, design extension conditions, severe accident management, long term operation (LTO) and safety culture. Such requests arrive from Member States with existing nuclear installations as well as from those considering embarking on nuclear power programmes. There was also an increase in the number of requests for support for training on safety assessment computational tools, probabilistic safety assessment, severe accident management guidelines, drafting of regulations, inspector training, and senior manager leadership and safety culture from Member States embarking on new nuclear power programmes.26. Many Member States considering embarking on a nuclear power programme or on a first research reactor project are facing difficulties in allocating resources for regulatory capacity building. In many of these Member States, the programme or project schedules allow only limited time for the regulatory body to establish its resources and competence to perform its regulatory functions effectively.27. Member State interest in EPR capacity building activities has continued to grow. The International Network for Education and Training for Emergency Preparedness and Response membership grew to 206 in 2022, up from 179 in 2021. Young graduates have shown interest in the opportunity to upgrade their qualifications in EPR: in 2022, the second year of the international master’s degree programme in EPR following its pilot implementation in 2021, 3 graduates applied to join the programme.![]( Statescontinue torequest Agency supportasthey developand strengthentheirnational provisionsforeducation,training,qualificationand competence inradiationprotectionand safety，inordertoachievecloser alignmentwithAgencysafetystandards.Capacity Building inNuclear,Radiation,Transportand Waste Safety,and in EmergencyPreparedness and Response# There is...·Anincrease inthe numberof requestsforsupport foreducationand trainingactivitiesrelatedtositeevaluationandoperationalsafetyofnuclear installations,designsafetyprotectionagainstexternal events,design extensionconditions,severeaccidentmanagement,LTOandsafetyculture fromMember Stateswithexistingnuclear installationsandthoseconsidering embarkingonnuclearpowerprogrammes;·Anincrease inthenumberof requests forsupportfortraining onsafety assessmentcomputationaltools,probabilisticsafetyassessment,severe accidentmanagementguidelines,draftingofregulations,inspectortraining andseniormanagerleadershipandsafetyculture fromMemberStates embarkingonnewnuclearpowerprogrammes;and·Agrowing interest inonlineandweb-basedtrainingonradiationprotection.# Need for...Developingorstrengtheningnationalandorganizationalknowledgemanagement programmesandcapacitybuildingfornuclearsafetyamongregulatorybodies, operators,aswell astechnical and scientificsupport organizations.# Related Activities28. The Agency will assist Member States in their capacity building programmes, in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety as well as EPR, and will assist Member States in developing their expertise in the relevant technical areas. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Support Member States in the development and strengthening of provisions for education, training, qualification and competence in radiation protection and safety, and on the establishment of national strategies in this area; Continue enhancing, including by virtual methods, education and training programmes and implementing capacity building activities in the areas of safety assessment and design safety, and operational safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs);?

Research and Development for Safety# Trends29. Much of the recent research and development work undertaken in Member States focused on severe accident phenomena and safety features for design extension conditions to ensure the practical elimination of conditions that can lead to early or large radioactive release should an accident occur.30. Member States continue to show high interest in research related to EPR, including in the effective use of dose projection tools, as demonstrated by their participation in and contribution to a coordinated research project on this topic.31. There is increased interest in Member States in the application of rapid characterization techniques for radiological contamination based on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with radiation detectors.# Related Activities# 32. The Agency will assist Member State efforts in the field of research and development for safety where the need for further work has been identified, and will facilitate the exchange of results. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Continue to encourage research and development on the basis of identified needs, particularly regarding advanced approaches in safety assessment, analysis of design extension conditions, new design features, and equipment qualification in severe accident conditions;Continue to conduct research and development activities in support of the safety of advanced/innovative reactors, including carrying out the study on the applicability of Agency safety standards to accident tolerant fuels; andOrganize training on the application of rapid characterization techniques based on the use of UAVs equipped with radiation detectors.# B. Strengthening Radiation, Transport and Waste SafetyB.1. Radiation Protection of Patients, Workers and the Public# Trends33. There is continued interest and awareness among Member States, including through Agency activities regarding naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), concerning the need to protect workers and properly manage residues in industrial operations and processes involving NORM, and to apply a graded approach to the use of regulatory and operator resources for these tasks in line with the International Basic Safety Standards (IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3).34. Member States continue to request Agency guidance as to how to consistently apply the requirements of GSR Part 3 relating to existing exposure situations to the entire, varied range of activities considered to be existing exposure situations. The application of a graded approach remains challenging for Member States dealing with regulatory control of existing exposure situations, such as in the context of international trade of commodities and criteria for exemption of surface-contaminated non-food commodities.35. High rates of participation in Agency activities and feedback from Member States both indicate a growing awareness among Member States of the effects of exposure due to radon in homes and workplaces and the need for the Agency to provide assistance in this field.36. The Agency has issued guidance on how to manage exposures due to radionuclides in food and drinking water in non-emergency situations. Member States’ requests to promote discussion and potential application of the recently released guidance confirm this to be a subject of significant concern.37. Member States continue to request assistance in establishing regulatory systems for the application of non-medical human imaging, the use of consumer products and the management of nonfood commodities containing radionuclides.38. The magnitude of recurrent radiological imaging of patients and the associated higher cumulated individual exposures have been shown to be more extensive than previously assumed. Interventional radiology procedures are rapidly becoming more frequent around the world, posing many additional challenges in terms of the radiation protection of patients and medical staff, including the risk of tissue reactions such as skin injuries for patients and eye lens opacities for staff. The number of radiotherapy treatment courses delivered per year globally is also increasing. Radiation protection and safety are of particular concern when this technology is introduced in countries and regions that have previously had only limited access to such applications.·Magnitudeofrecurrentradiological imagingandtheassociatedhigher exposurearemoreextensivethanpreviouslyknown;·Application of graded approachto regulating existing exposure situations remainsachallenge;and·GrowingawarenessamongMember Statesofthe health effectsof exposure to radonin homesand workplaces.![]( Need for...·Revised guidanceregardingtheapplicationof regulatoryflexibilityinexemptio andclearance;and·Protection ofworkersand propermanagement of residuesin industrial processes involvingNORM.# Related Activities39. The Agency will assist Member States in the application of the Agency’s safety standards, in particular the International Basic Safety Standards (GSR Part 3), in radiation protection of people and the environment for applications such as waste management, transport of radioactive material, and research, medical and industrial uses of radionuclides. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Support Member States in the establishment of regulatory systems for the safe management of NORM;Develop new guidance on radiation protection and safety in existing exposure situations; Organize regional workshops on the regulatory control of existing exposure situations, radon and non-medical imaging, among others;Hold a Technical Meeting on Radiation Protection of Paediatric and Pregnant Patients; and Hold a Technical Meeting on Advisory Services for Radiation Protection and Safety for Medical Exposures.# B.2. Control of Radiation Sources# Trends40. The increased use of sealed radioactive sources in medicine, industry, agriculture and research has resulted in a need to ensure appropriate arrangements for the control of sources and the safe and secure management of disused sealed radioactive sources, including national strategies for managing disused radioactive sources and establishing national programmes and regulatory requirements.41. Member States continue to request further guidance on the application of paragraph 22(b) of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources on ensuring financial provisions for the safe management and secure protection of radioactive sources once they have become disused, as well as on regulatory requirements for the different options in the management of disused sources.42. In 2022, five additional Member States made a political commitment to implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, with the total number increasing to 145. Six Member States notified the Director General of their intention to act in a harmonized manner with the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources, meaning that the total number of Member States that have done so increased to 129. Four additional Member States nominated points of contact for facilitating the import and export of radioactive sources, bringing the total number of Member States that have done so to 149, and 8 Member States made a political commitment to implementing the supplementary Guidance on the Management of Disused Radioactive Sources, bringing the total that have done so to 52 (see Figure 4).![]( 4.

This will ultimately help us build a competitive portfolio of new U.S. reactors that offer significant improvements over today’s technology.The advanced reactors selected for \\\\xa0are an excellent representation of the  currently under development in the United States. They range from advanced light-water-cooled small modular reactors to new designs that use molten salts and high-temperature gases to flexibly operate at even higher temperatures and lower pressures.All of them have the potential to compete globally once deployed and will offer consumers more access to a reliable, clean power source that can be depended on in the near-future to  electricity, drive industrial processes and even provide potable drinking water to communities in water-scarce locations.### Demonstrating Advanced ReactorsTwo ARDP demonstration projects are currently moving forward as TerraPower and X-energy aggressively work with their teams to plan for and ultimately deliver . And, although these designs may be further along in the technology development process at this time, we recognize that other domestic vendors need additional financial, technical, and regulatory support to mature their designs.Many companies don’t have access to the infrastructure, facilities and computer models needed to gather the data that’s required to prove to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that these reactors work as designed.To help lower this technology development risk, we awarded $30 million to five U.S. teams to address the technical, operational and licensing challenges that they currently face. The goal is to improve technology readiness and prepare them for future demonstration, and eventual deployment.Here’s a quick look at five U.S. designs that could be operational within the next 14 years.### BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor!Design concept of BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor.BWX TechnologiesBWX Technologies is developing a transportable microreactor that can thrive in off-grid applications and remote areas to produce 50 megawatts of thermal energy for deployment in the early 2030s. The high-temperature gas reactor uses a different form of  that contains a uranium nitride fuel kernel for higher performance. The team will work with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to test and qualify the fuel. They will also focus on optimizing new manufacturing technologies that could help cut the cost of microreactors in half and develop capabilities that could benefit other advanced reactor designs in the process.### eVinciTM Microreactor!Design concept of Westinghouse eVinci microreactor.Westinghouse NuclearWestinghouse Electric Company is also pursuing a transportable microreactor that can be installed on-site in less than 30 days. The 15 megawatt thermal reactor utilizes TRISO fuel and a specialized heat pipe design to flexibly operate on a grid or in remote locations. The company will work with Los Alamos National Laboratory, INL, and Texas A&M University to test and manufacture components for its heat pipe and moderator in order to develop a small demonstration unit. This short term, two-year project supports a larger effort by Westinghouse to demonstrate a prototype reactor by 2024, with full commercial deployment targeted for the mid-to-late 2020s.### Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor!Design concept of Kairos Power fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor.Kairos PowerKairos Power will work with ORNL, INL, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Materion Corp.\\\\xa0to deploy Hermes, a low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, TN. Hermes is a key milestone in the company\\'s rapid iterative development pathway to prove its fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor can ultimately deliver low-cost nuclear heat. The reactor will use a TRISO fuel pebble bed design with a molten fluoride salt coolant and will achieve a thermal power level of 35 MWth. Hermes will be the predecessor to Kairos Power\\'s future 140 MWe commercial reactor and could be operational by 2026.### Holtec SMR-160 Reactor!Design concept of Holtec SMR-160 nuclear power plant.Holtec InternationalHoltec is partnering with Kiewit Power Constructors, Framatome, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products, Western Services Corporation and INL to complete the early-stage research and power plant development work needed to demonstrate its advanced light-water small modular reactor. The 160 megawatt electric design can be adapted to use air-cooled condensers on its secondary side, allowing it to be deployed in the most arid regions of the world. Holtec has excellent manufacturing capabilities and can fabricate the majority of the components right here in the United States. They plan to demonstrate the reactor at the Oyster Creek site in New Jersey, following the decommissioning of that nuclear power plant.### Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment!Design concept of TerraPower molten chloride fast reactor technology.TerraPowerSouthern Company is looking to build and operate a small reactor experiment based on TerraPower’s molten chloride fast reactor (MCFR) technology. The MCFR can be scaled up for commercial use on the grid and could flexibly operate on multiple fuels, including used nuclear fuel from other reactors.

China’s State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) has emerged as the leading bidder for this project.In 2025, Türkiye expects the first unit of Akkuyu to enter trial operations, marking the country’s entry into nuclear energy production. This year will also witness further advancements in Türkiye’s nuclear regulatory framework, which will prioritize safety and emergency response protocols. Furthermore, negotiations regarding the Sinop and Thrace projects are expected to progress, potentially resulting in new partnerships and funding agreements.]( Africa’s Nuclear Energy Expansion:**Africa is rapidly increasing its focus on nuclear energy to drive economic development and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Several African nations are moving forward with nuclear power projects, Rwanda demonstrated its commitment to advanced nuclear technology through agreements with Nano Nuclear Energy and Dual Fluid Energy, aiming to introduce both small modular reactors and an experimental reactor. In South Africa, the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) gained significant momentum with the HTMR-100 project, which secured a ZAR9 billion (USD 480 million) financing deal between Koya Capital and Stratek Global.Ghana established itself as a leader in nuclear education by launching Africa\\'s first Regional Clean Energy Training Centre, developed in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC). This center is dedicated to training a workforce adept at managing nuclear energy projects throughout Africa. Additionally, at the 26th World Energy Congress in Rotterdam, Nuclear Power Ghana and CNNC Overseas Limited formalized a cooperation agreement for deploying a Hualong One (HPR-1000) nuclear power project. Meanwhile, in Egypt, Rosatom reported substantial progress at the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, with approximately 30% of the project completed by the end of 2024, signaling a significant step forward in North Africa\\'s nuclear ambitions. These developments collectively underscore a year of considerable advancement and strategic partnerships in the African nuclear energy landscape.This year will witness for major developments in this regard, the continent has the potential to achieve 15 GW of operational nuclear capacity by 2035, demonstrating the pivotal role of nuclear energy in fostering economic growth and advancing climate action. Leading this transformative effort are nations such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco, which have made significant strides in their nuclear energy programs.In short, the year 2025 promises to be a transformative period for the nuclear energy sector, driven by advancements in technology, regulatory reforms, and international collaborations.

(Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)The nuclear energy industry is seeing  in global interest as governments, utilities, and tech giants seek to meet soaring electricity demand with around-the-clock, carbon-free power.That’s true for not only conventional nuclear power plants but also a\\xa0suite of alternative technologies known as \\u200b“ ,” or SMRs, which proponents say could deliver nuclear energy at far lower costs and on faster timescales.Broadly defined, SMRs include designs ranging in capacity from 1\\xa0megawatt to several hundred megawatts. They encompass reactors using the same light-water technology that’s inside most existing nuclear plants, as well as projects with gas-cooled reactors or that use  like high-assay low-enriched uranium.Seventy-four SMR designs are actively being developed worldwide, according to  from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), an intergovernmental agency within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Of that group, 51 designs are involved in pre-licensing or licensing activities with nuclear safety regulators in 15 countries — including the United States — marking a\\xa065% increase in such efforts since 2023. The NEA said this growth reflects significant progress in bringing paper concepts closer to real-world projects, though only two commercial SMRs are actually operating today.There’s \\u200b“a real momentum behind this class of technologies,” William D. Magwood IV, the director-general of NEA, told reporters last week ahead of the July 22 launch of the agency’s updated SMR-tracking report.At least $15 billion in public and private financing is now flowing into the SMR space, by the agency’s count.![]( screenshot of NEA\\'s small modular reactor dashboard shows licensing progress of designs worldwide. (NEA)The idea for small-scale reactors isn’t new: Nuclear scientists have been  for over half a\\xa0century, ever since the first fission power plants went critical in the 1950s. Previous attempts to quickly and cheaply build smaller plants have failed, though nuclear advocates say the technology is finally ready to launch — as long as the industry can overcome the high technical and regulatory barriers that ensnared earlier generations.“I’ve seen small reactors come and go over the years,” said Magwood. \\u200b“The economics and other issues have always held them back. But what’s really different this time is that the need for [SMRs] is very clearly there.”## **A growing list of hopeful SMR projects**Proponents envision SMRs as a\\xa0more nimble alternative to the giant power plants that currently provide  of global electricity today.Large-scale reactors can deliver gigawatts of baseload electricity, but they require a\\xa0staggering amount of time and resources to build. In Georgia, Plant Vogtle’s 2.2GW expansion took 15\\xa0years and cost  by the time the project was completed in April 2024. The challenging economics — plus the complications of handling radioactive waste and the risk of  — help explain why nuclear power has stagnated over the years and is used in only 31 countries.With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs. The designs being developed today aim to do everything from powering merchant ships and off-grid mining operations to supplying baseload power for data centers and producing high-temperature heat for manufacturing.“SMR is not one thing — it’s a\\xa0wide range of sizes, a\\xa0wide range of temperatures,” said Diane Cameron, who leads NEA’s division of nuclear technology development and economics.“This is both an opportunity and a\\xa0challenge,” she said on the press call. \\u200b“There’s a\\xa0lot going on, and sometimes financiers or regulators and policymakers are wondering where to focus their efforts first.” That includes figuring out how to handle new types of nuclear-fuel waste streams from cutting-edge SMR designs, in addition to the mounting waste from conventional reactors.![]( Darlington nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. (OPG)So far, however, SMRs have yet to reach their potential.Cameron noted that the only commercial reactors generating electricity today include  at China’s Shidaowan Bay nuclear plant — in which two small units drive a\\xa0single 210MW steam turbine — and a\\xa070MW  on a\\xa0barge in Russia.

The project will use the light-water  reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy — a\\xa0design that stretches the meaning of the word \\u200b“small.” A\\xa0single reactor building will reach an estimated 220\\xa0feet above ground and nearly 112\\xa0feet below\\xa0grade.The BWRX-300 units will each be capable of generating 300MW, or enough to power about 300,000 homes, with the first unit expected to be in service by the end of 2030. The total 1.2GW Darlington project could cost around  to complete.![]( rendering shows the BWRX-300 reactor installed at the Darlington nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. (OPG)In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority became the  to submit a\\xa0construction permit application — for the BWRX-300 — with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which accepted the application on July 10. After regulatory approval, which is expected by the end of 2026, the TVA plans to install the design at its Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and to commission the plant by\\xa02032.The startup Kairos Power is also developing an SMR project in Oak Ridge, but at a\\xa0much smaller scale and with a\\xa0less conventional design: a\\xa0molten fluoride salt coolant and a\\xa0higher-concentration uranium fuel recipe.The company aims to start operating a\\xa035MW thermal Hermes reactor as early as 2026, with a\\xa0commercial version to be deployed in the 2030s. On July 16, the company said it had  the reactor vessel for its third engineering test unit, which will inform the design of its first reactor. The Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to provide  for the $629 million project through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.![]( Power collaborated with Barnard Construction to install the reactor vessel for the non-nuclear Engineering Test Unit 3.0 at Kairos Power’s site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. (Kairos)Meanwhile, in Wyoming, Bill Gates’ startup TerraPower  nonnuclear construction work for a\\xa0345MW reactor near a\\xa0retiring coal plant in Kemmerer. The company’s Natrium reactor, which it aims to bring online in 2030, is a\\xa0sodium-cooled fast reactor with a\\xa0molten-salt-based storage system and is expected to cost up to $4 billion to complete — with the DOE slated to cover half of that tab through the demonstration program.The DOE launched the program in 2020, during the first Trump administration. Trump’s second administration is now doubling down on federal support for nuclear projects even as it  for other carbon-free power sources like wind and\\xa0solar.The administration wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050.\\xa0To get there, it has  accelerating the licensing process for new reactors and speeding up regulatory reviews, going as far as to  the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \\u200b“rubber stamp” new reactor designs. Earlier this month, the NRC  for TerraPower’s construction permit application by seven months. The agency said it now plans to issue its final safety evaluation and environmental review for the Wyoming project by December 31,\\xa02025.“There’s tremendous activity here in the United States directed towards deploying all forms of new nuclear” to meet growing electricity demand, John Kotek, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a\\xa0U.S. trade association, said on the press\\xa0call.With the emergence of next-generation tech from Kairos and TerraPower, he said, \\u200b“it’s really much more like Silicon Valley than the traditional nuclear industry here in the U.S.”- **Subscribe to our newsletters** Stay up-to-date on clean energy news.+ more optionsCanary Media DailyCanary Media WeeklyNortheast Energy NewsSoutheast Energy NewsMidwest Energy NewsWestern Energy NewsBy subscribing, you agree to our .is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

And the anticipated dates for when they\\'ll produce power are almost certainly unrealistic. NuScale failed because local utilities decided the cost of electricity was going to be too high. The same problem exists for the various projects described in this article.R0 points3 months agoThe SMR PowerPoint industry, is just that. There were SMRs built in the U.S. in the 1950s-early 70s. they didn\\'t pan out economically, so the industry upped the size to get an economy of size advantage. These newer SMR designs would get a dis-economy of scale, costing more than the 2 large Vogtle reactors, recently completed. Vogtle will be about 30-33¢/kWh delivered, and these would probably be 40-50¢/kWh delivered.The industry has touted their economy of scale, but never mentions the economy of size. The economy of scale would not kick in if ever, until many units were built. The U.S. and French nuclear industries never experienced a learning curve, but instead kept going up in cost in real dollars. This is an economic bubble in the infant stages.R0 points3 months ago. . . As the article sub-caption says, \"Nuclear experts say 74 SMR designs are under active development worldwide.\" The industry has been saying that SMRs will help nuclear go with standardized designs. With 74 designs, it\\'s going go be a long time before any serious standardization occurs. Learning curves are higher when there is standardization. This does not look like standardization; it looks like a free-for-all to me.MMichael Leaf0 points3 months agoI highly recommend the research paper \"Smaller nuclear reactors (SMRs) are a costly dead end, especially for AI\" by Joseph Romm of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability, and the Media: JJohn Unger0 points3 months agoWhat will we do with all of the additional waste if this nightmare of nuclear expansion occurs?

Small modular reactors, deployable either as single or multi-module plant, offer the possibility to combine nuclear with alternative energy sources, including renewables.## Small modular reactors: flexible and affordable power generationGlobal interest in small and medium sized or modular reactors has been increasing due to their ability to meet the need for flexible power generation for a wider range of users and applications and replace ageing fossil fuel-fired power plants. They also display an enhanced safety performance through inherent and passive safety features, offer better upfront capital cost affordability and are suitable for cogeneration and non-electric applications. In addition, they offer options for remote regions with less developed infrastructures and the possibility for synergetic hybrid energy systems that combine nuclear and alternate energy sources, including renewables.Many Member States are focusing on the development of small modular reactors, which are defined as advanced reactors that produce electricity of up to 300 MW(e) per module. These reactors have advanced engineered features, are deployable either as a single or multi-module plant, and are designed to be built in factories and shipped to utilities for installation as demand arises.There are more than 80 SMR designs and concepts globally.

We address the energy system itself (sources, conversion, end use), economics (prices, investment, market failures), social outcomes (well-being, energy poverty, and climate justice), and environmental change (climate, pollution, and land and water use).### How are we differentThe internet is awash in information about energy, climate change, and health impacts of pollution. But society is deficient in a shared understanding of how our energy system must change. One reason for that is that information is siloed by technology, policy, and disciplines. We use the unique role of energy in human affairs and natural systems as the unifying principle behind compelling, data-driven stories that point to solutions that are feasible, affordable, and equitable. We are interdisciplinary and collaborative, working with diverse teams and perspectives that span the broad energy landscape.### Open accessVisualizing Energy aims to accelerate a sustainable energy transition by deploying a more equitable system of knowledge.

The United States has the most capacity, followed by France, China, Russia, and South Korea, based on  (IAEA) data as of June 2025. Globally, 416 nuclear power reactors are operating in 31 countries, with a total installed  of 376 gigawatts (GW).The development of nuclear power plants for commercial electricity generation began in the United States in the late 1950s with the commissioning of the  in Pennsylvania. Most of the operating U.S. nuclear generating capacity was constructed between 1967 and 1990.Electric utilities in the United States currently operate , and the country is the world's largest producer of nuclear electricity. Domestically, nuclear electricity accounted for  (GWh), or , in 2024. U.S. nuclear electricity accounted for  in 2023. The U.S. nuclear reactor fleet operates at a comparatively high  (92% in 2024) because of increased utility efficiency in managing planned and unplanned generation outages.France maintains the second-largest nuclear reactor fleet in the world and the largest nuclear reactor fleet in Europe with  with a total installed generating capacity of 63 GW. Nuclear reactors in France generated over  of electricity in 2023, which was nearly 65% of the country’s total electricity generation.

Chernobyl involved an intense fire without provision for containment, and Fukushima Daiichi severely tested the containment, allowing some release of radioactivity.**- **These are the only major accidents to have occurred in over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 36 countries.**- **The evidence over six decades shows that nuclear power is a safe means of generating electricity. The risk of accidents in nuclear power plants is low and declining. The consequences of an accident or terrorist attack are minimal compared with other commonly accepted risks. Radiological effects on people of any radioactive releases can be avoided.**In relation to nuclear power, safety is closely linked with security, and in the nuclear field also with safeguards. Some distinctions apply:- Safety focuses on unintended conditions or events leading to radiological releases from authorized activities. It relates mainly to intrinsic problems or hazards.- Security focuses on the intentional misuse of nuclear or other radioactive materials by non-state elements to cause harm. It relates mainly to external threats to materials or facilities (ee information page on ).- Safeguarding focuses on restraining activities by states that could lead to acquisition or development of nuclear weapons. It concerns mainly materials and equipment in relation to rogue governments (see information page on ).No industry is immune from accidents, but all industries learn from them. In civil aviation, there are accidents every year and each is meticulously analysed. The lessons from nearly one hundred years’ experience mean that reputable airlines are extremely safe. In the chemical industry and oil-gas industry, major accidents also lead to improved safety. There is wide public acceptance that the risks associated with these industries are an acceptable trade-off for our dependence on their products and services. With nuclear power, the high energy density makes the potential hazard obvious, and this has always been factored into the design of nuclear power plants. The few accidents have been spectacular and newsworthy, but of little consequence in terms of human fatalities. The novelty value and hence newsworthiness of nuclear power accidents remains high in contrast with other industrial accidents, which receive comparatively little news coverage.## Harnessing the world\\'s most concentrated energy sourceIn the 1950s attention turned to harnessing the power of the atom in a controlled way, as demonstrated at Chicago in 1942 and subsequently for military research, and applying the steady heat yield to generate electricity. This naturally gave rise to concerns about accidents and their possible effects.\\xa0However, with nuclear power, safety depends on much the same factors as in any comparable industry: intelligent planning, proper design with conservative margins and back-up systems, high-quality components and a well-developed safety culture in operations.\\xa0The operating lives of reactors depend on maintaining their safety margin.A particular nuclear scenario was loss of cooling which resulted in melting of the nuclear reactor core, and this motivated studies on both the physical and chemical possibilities as well as the biological effects of any dispersed radioactivity. Those responsible for nuclear power technology in the West devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring that a meltdown of the reactor core would not take place, since it was assumed that a meltdown of the core would create a major public hazard, and if uncontained, a tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities.In avoiding such accidents the industry has been very successful. In the 60-year history of civil nuclear power generation, with over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years across 36 countries, there have been only three significant accidents at nuclear power plants:-  (USA 1979) where the reactor was severely damaged but radiation was contained and there were no adverse health or environmental consequences.-  (Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of the reactor by steam explosion and fire killed two people initially plus a further 28 from radiation poisoning within three months, and had significant health and environmental consequences.- \\xa0(Japan 2011) where three old reactors (together with a fourth) were written off after the effects of loss of cooling due to a huge tsunami were inadequately contained.\\xa0There were no deaths or serious injuries due to radioactivity, though about 19,500 people were killed by the tsunami.Of all the accidents and incidents, only the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents resulted in radiation doses to the public greater than those resulting from the exposure to natural sources. The Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation exposure of workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their health, unlike Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one \\'accident\\') have been completely confined to the plant.Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident. Most of the serious radiological injuries and deaths that occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures above regulatory limits) are the result of large uncontrolled radiation sources, such as abandoned medical or industrial equipment. (There have also been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing pile – at Windscale, UK, in 1957\\xa0– but none of these resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination.) \\xa0See also Table in .!It should be emphasized that a commercial-type power reactor simply cannot under any circumstances explode like a nuclear bomb – the fuel is not enriched beyond about 5%, and much higher enrichment is needed for explosives.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was set up by the United Nations in 1957. One of its functions was to act as an auditor of world nuclear safety, and this role was increased greatly following the Chernobyl accident.\\xa0It prescribes safety procedures and the reporting of even minor incidents. Its role has been strengthened since 1996 (see ). Every country which operates nuclear power plants has a nuclear safety inspectorate and all of these work closely with the IAEA.While nuclear power plants are designed to be safe in their operation and safe in the event of any malfunction or accident, no industrial activity can be represented as entirely risk-free. Incidents and accidents may happen, and as in other industries, what is learned will lead to a progressive improvement in safety.\\xa0Those improvements are both in new designs, and in upgrading of existing plants. The long-term operation (LTO) of established plants is achieved by significant investment in such upgrading.The safety of operating staff is a prime concern in nuclear plants. Radiation exposure is minimized by the use of remote handling equipment for many operations in the core of the reactor. Other controls include physical shielding and limiting the time workers spend in areas with significant radiation levels. These are supported by continuous monitoring of individual doses and of the work environment to ensure very low radiation exposure compared with other industries.The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation can be considered extremely safe. Every year several hundred people die in coal mines to provide this widely used fuel for electricity. There are also significant health and environmental effects arising from fossil fuel use. Contrary to popular belief, nuclear power saves lives by displacing fossil fuel from the electricity mix.## Achieving safety: the reactor coreConcerning possible accidents, up to the early 1970s, some extreme assumptions were made about the possible chain of consequences. These gave rise to a genre of dramatic fiction (e.g.\\xa0_The China Syndrome_) in the public domain and also some solid conservative engineering including containment structures in the industry itself. Licensing regulations were framed accordingly.It was not until the late 1970s that detailed analyses and large-scale testing, followed by the 1979 meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor, began to make clear that even the worst possible accident in a conventional western nuclear power plant or its fuel would not be likely to cause dramatic public harm. The industry still works hard to minimize the probability of a meltdown accident, but it is now clear that no-one need fear a potential public health catastrophe simply because a fuel meltdown happens. Fukushima Daiichi has made that clear, with a triple meltdown causing no fatalities or serious radiation doses to anyone, while over two hundred people continued working onsite to mitigate the accident\\'s effects.The decades-long test and analysis programme showed that less radioactivity escapes from molten fuel than initially assumed, and that most of this radioactive material is not readily mobilized beyond the immediate internal structure. Thus, even if the containment structure that surrounds all modern nuclear plants were ruptured, as was the case with one of the Fukushima reactors, it is still very effective in preventing the escape of most radioactivity.A mandated safety indicator is the calculated probable frequency of degraded core or core melt accidents. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) specifies that reactor designs must meet a theoretical 1 in 10,000 year core damage frequency, but modern designs exceed this. US utility requirements are 1 in 100,000 years, the best currently operating plants are about 1 in one million and those likely to be built in the next decade are almost 1 in 10 million. While this calculated core damage frequency has been one of the main metrics to assess reactor safety, European safety authorities prefer a deterministic approach, focusing on actual provision of back-up hardware, though they also undertake probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) for core damage frequency,\\xa0and require a 1 in 1 million core damage frequency for new designs.Even months after the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in 1979 it was assumed that there had been no core melt because there were no indications of severe radioactive release even inside the containment. It turned out that in fact about half the core had melted. Until 2011 this remained the only core melt in a reactor conforming to NRC safety criteria, and the effects were contained as designed, without radiological harm to anyone.* Greifswald 5 in East Germany had a partial core melt in November 1989, due to malfunctioning valves (root cause: shoddy manufacture) and was never restarted. At Fukushima in 2011 (a different reactor design with penetrations in the bottom of the pressure vessel) the three reactor cores evidently largely melted in the first two or three days, but this was not confirmed for about ten weeks. It is still not certain how much of the core material was not contained by the pressure vessels and ended up in the bottom of the drywell containments, though certainly there was considerable release of radionuclides to the atmosphere early on, and later to cooling water**.* About this time there was alarmist talk of the so-called \\'China Syndrome\\', a scenario where the core of such a reactor would melt, and due to continual heat generation, melt its way through the reactor pressure vessel and concrete foundations to keep going, perhaps until it reached China on the other side of the globe! The TMI accident proved the extent of truth in the proposition, and the molten core material got exactly 15 mm of the way to China as it froze on the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel.** Ignoring isotopic differences, there are about one hundred different fission products in fuel which has been undergoing fission. A few of these are gases at normal temperatures, more are volatile at higher temperatures, and both will be released from the fuel if the cladding is damaged. The latter include iodine (easily volatilized, at 184°C) and caesium (671°C), which were the main radionuclides released at Fukushima, first into the reactor pressure vessel and then into the containment which in unit 2 apparently ruptured early on day 5. In addition, as cooling water was flushed through the hot core, soluble fission products such as caesium dissolved in it, which created the need for a large water treatment plant to remove them.Apart from these accidents and the Chernobyl disaster there have been about ten core melt accidents – mostly in military or experimental reactors –  lists most of them. None resulted in any hazard outside the plant from the core melting, though in one case there was significant radiation release due to burning fuel in hot graphite (similar to Chernobyl but smaller scale). The Fukushima accident should also be considered in that context, since the fuel was badly damaged and there were significant off-site radiation releases.Licensing approval for new plants today requires that the effects of any core-melt accident must be confined to the plant itself, without the need to evacuate nearby residents.The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material, leading to contamination and consequent radiation exposure off-site. Earlier assumptions were that this would be likely in the event of a major loss of cooling accident (LOCA) which resulted in a core melt. The TMI experience suggested otherwise, but at Fukushima this is exactly what happened. In the light of better understanding of the physics and chemistry of material in a reactor core under extreme conditions it became evident that even a severe core melt coupled with breach of containment would be unlikely to create a major radiological disaster from many Western reactor designs, but the Fukushima accident showed that this did not apply to all. Studies of the post-accident situation at TMI (where there was no breach of containment) supported the suggestion, and analysis of Fukushima will be incomplete until the reactors are dismantled.Certainly the matter was severely tested with three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in March 2011. Cooling was lost about an hour after a shutdown, and it proved impossible to restore it sufficiently to prevent severe damage to the fuel. The reactors, dating from 1971-75, were written off. A fourth is also written off due to damage from a hydrogen explosion.## Achieving optimum nuclear safetyA fundamental principle of nuclear power plant operation worldwide is that the operator is responsible for safety. The national regulator is responsible for ensuring the plants are operated safely by the licensee, and that the design is approved. A second important concept is that a regulator’s mission is to protect people and the environment.Design certification of reactors is also the responsibility of national regulators. There is international collaboration among these to varying degrees, and\\xa0there are a number of sets of mechanical codes and standards related to quality and safety.With new reactor designs being established on a more international basis since the 1990s, both the industry and regulators are seeking greater design standardization and also regulatory harmonization. The role of the World Nuclear Association\\'s Cooperation in Reactor Design Evaluation and Licensing (CORDEL) Working Group and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency\\'s (NEA\\'s) Multinational Design Evaluation Programme (MDEP) are described in the information page on\\xa0.An OECD-NEA report in 2010 pointed out that the theoretically-calculated frequency for a large release of radioactivity from a severe nuclear power plant accident has reduced by a factor of 1600 between the early Generation I reactors as originally built and the Generation III/III+ plants being built today. Earlier designs however have been progressively upgraded through their operating lives.It has long been asserted that nuclear reactor accidents are the epitome of low-probability but high-consequence risks. Understandably, with this in mind, some people were disinclined to accept the risk, however low the probability. However, the physics and chemistry of a reactor core, coupled with but not wholly depending on the engineering, mean that the consequences of an accident are likely in fact be much less severe than those from other industrial and energy sources. Experience, including Fukushima, bears this out.A 2009 US Department of Energy (DOE)  notes: \"The aviation industry, medical industry, commercial nuclear power industry, US Navy, DOE and its contractors, and other high-risk, technologically complex organizations have adopted human performance principles, concepts, and practices to consciously reduce human error and bolster controls in order to reduce accidents and events... About 80% of all events are attributed to human error. In some industries, this number is closer to 90%. Roughly 20% of events involve equipment failures. When the 80% human error is broken down further, it reveals that the majority of errors associated with events stem from latent organizational weaknesses (perpetrated by humans in the past that lie dormant in the system), whereas about 30% are caused by the individual worker touching the equipment and systems in the facility. Clearly, focusing efforts on reducing human error will reduce the likelihood of events.\" Following the Fukushima accident the focus has been on the organizational weaknesses which increase the likelihood of human error.### Defence-in-depthTo achieve optimum safety, nuclear plants in the western world operate using a **\\'defence-in-depth\\' approach**, with multiple safety systems supplementing the natural features of the reactor core. Key aspects of the approach are:- High-quality design & construction.- Equipment which prevents operational disturbances or human failures and errors developing into problems.- Comprehensive monitoring and regular testing to detect equipment or operator failures.- Redundant and diverse systems to control damage to the fuel and prevent significant radioactive releases.- Provision to confine the effects of severe fuel damage (or any other problem) to the plant itself.These can be summed up as: prevention, monitoring, and action (to mitigate consequences of failures).The safety provisions include a series of physical barriers between the radioactive reactor core and the environment, the provision of multiple safety systems, each with backup and designed to accommodate human error. As well as the physical aspects of safety, there are institutional aspects which are no less important – see following section on International Collaboration.The barriers in a typical plant are: the fuel is in the form of solid ceramic (UO2) pellets, and radioactive fission products remain largely bound inside these pellets as the fuel is burned. The pellets are packed inside sealed zirconium alloy tubes to form fuel rods. These are confined inside a large steel pressure vessel with walls up to 30 cm thick – the associated primary water cooling pipework is also substantial. All this, in turn, is enclosed inside a robust reinforced concrete containment structure with walls at least one metre thick. This amounts to three significant barriers around the fuel, which itself is stable up to very high temperatures.These barriers are monitored continually. The fuel cladding is monitored by measuring the amount of radioactivity in the cooling water. The high pressure cooling system is monitored by the leak rate of water, and the containment structure by periodically measuring the leak rate of air at about five times atmospheric pressure.Looked at functionally, the three basic safety functions in a nuclear reactor are:- To control reactivity.- To cool the fuel.- To contain radioactive substances.The main safety features of most reactors are inherent – negative temperature coefficient and negative void coefficient. The first means that beyond an optimal level, as the temperature increases the efficiency of the reaction decreases (this in fact is used to control power levels in some new designs). The second means that if any steam has formed in the cooling water there is a decrease in moderating effect so that fewer neutrons are able to cause fission and the reaction slows down automatically.In the 1950s and 1960s some experimental reactors in Idaho were deliberately tested to destruction to verify that large reactivity excursions were self-limiting and would automatically shut down the fission reaction. These tests verified that this was the case.Beyond the control rods which are inserted to absorb neutrons and regulate the fission process, the main engineered safety provisions are the back-up emergency core cooling system (ECCS) to remove excess heat (though it is more to prevent damage to the plant than for public safety) and the containment.Traditional reactor safety systems are \\'active\\' in the sense that they involve electrical or mechanical operation on command. Some engineered systems operate passively, e.g. pressure relief valves. Both require parallel redundant systems. Inherent or full passive safety design depends only on physical phenomena such as convection, gravity or resistance to high temperatures, not on functioning of engineered components. All reactors have some elements of inherent safety as mentioned above, but in some recent designs the passive or inherent features substitute for active systems in cooling etc. Such a design would have averted the Fukushima accident, where loss of electrical power resulted is loss of cooling function.The basis of design assumes a threat where due to accident or malign intent (e.g. terrorism) there is core melting and a breach of containment. This double possibility has been well studied and provides the basis of exclusion zones and contingency plans. Apparently during the Cold War neither Russia nor the USA targeted the other\\'s nuclear power plants because the likely damage would be modest.Nuclear power plants are designed with sensors to shut them down automatically in an earthquake, and this is a vital consideration in many parts of the world. (See    paper)## Severe accident managementIn addition to engineering and procedures which reduce the risk and severity of accidents, all plants have guidelines for severe accident management or mitigation (SAM). These conspicuously came into play after the Fukushima accident, where staff had immense challenges in the absence of power and with disabled cooling systems following damage done by the tsunami. The experience following that accident is being applied not only in design but also in such guidelines, and peer reviews on nuclear plants are focusing more on these than previously.In mid-2011 the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre launched a new secure web-based communications platform to unify and simplify information exchange during nuclear or radiological emergencies. The Unified System for Information Exchange on Incidents and Emergencies (USIE) has been under development since 2009 but was actually launched during the emergency response to the accident at Fukushima.In both the TMI and Fukushima accidents the problems started after the reactors were shut down – immediately at TMI and after an hour at Fukushima, when the tsunami arrived. The need to remove decay heat from the fuel was not met in each case, so core melting started to occur within a few hours. Cooling requires water circulation and an external heat sink. If pumps cannot run due to lack of power, gravity must be relied upon, but this will not get water into a pressurized system – either reactor pressure vessel or containment. Hence there is provision for relieving pressure, sometimes with a vent system, but this must work and be controlled without power. There is a question of filters or scrubbers in the vent system: these need to be such that they do not block due to solids being carried. Ideally any vent system should deal with any large amounts of hydrogen, as at Fukushima, and have minimum potential to spread radioactivity outside the plant.\\xa0Filtered containment ventilation systems (FCVSs) have been retrofitted to some reactors which did not already have them, or any of sufficient capacity, following the Fukushima accident. The basic premise of a FCVS is that, independent of the state of the reactor itself, the catastrophic failure of the containment structure can be avoided by discharging steam, air and incondensable gases like hydrogen to the atmosphere.The Three Mile Island accident in 1979\\xa0demonstrated the importance of the inherent safety features. Despite the fact that about half of the reactor core melted, radionuclides released from the melted fuel mostly plated out on the inside of the plant or dissolved in condensing steam. The containment building which housed the reactor further prevented any significant release of radioactivity. The accident was attributed to mechanical failure and operator confusion. The reactor\\'s other protection systems also functioned as designed. The emergency core cooling system would have prevented any damage to the reactor but for the intervention of the operators.Investigations following the accident led to a new focus on the human factors in nuclear safety. No major design changes were called for in western reactors, but controls and instrumentation were improved significantly and operator training was overhauled.At Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 the three operating reactors shut down automatically, and were being cooled as designed by the normal residual heat removal system using power from the back-up generators, until the tsunami swamped them an hour later. The emergency core cooling systems then failed. Days later, a separate problem emerged as spent fuel ponds lost water. Analysis of the accident showed the need for more intelligent siting criteria than those used in the 1960s, and the need for better back-up power and post-shutdown cooling, as well as provision for venting the containment of that kind of reactor and other emergency management procedures.Nuclear plants have Severe Accident Mitigation Guidelines (SAMG, or in Japan: SAG), and most of these,\\xa0including all those in the USA, address what should be done for accidents beyond design basis, and where several systems may be disabled. See section below.In 2007 the US NRC launched a research program to assess the possible consequences of a serious reactor accident. Its draft report was released nearly a year after the Fukushima accident had partly confirmed its findings. The State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequences Analysis (SOARCA) showed that a severe accident at a US nuclear power plant (PWR or BWR) would not be likely to cause any immediate deaths, and the risks of fatal cancers would be vastly less than the general risks of cancer. SOARCA\\'s main conclusions fall into three areas: how a reactor accident progresses; how existing systems and emergency measures can affect an accident\\'s outcome; and how an accident would affect the public\\'s health. The principal conclusion is that existing resources and procedures can stop an accident, slow it down or reduce its impact before it can affect the public, but even if accidents proceed without such mitigation they take much longer to happen and release much less radioactive material than earlier analyses suggested. \\xa0This was borne out at Fukushima, where there was ample time for evacuation – three days – before any significant radioactive releases.In 2015 the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) released its . This was the result of research and analysis undertaken to address concerns raised during public hearings in 2012 on the environmental assessment for the refurbishment of Ontario Power Generation\\'s (OPG\\'s) Darlington nuclear power plant. The study involved identifying and modelling a large atmospheric release of radionuclides from a hypothetical severe nuclear accident at the four-unit Darlington power plant; estimating the doses to individuals at various distances from the plant, after factoring in protective actions such as evacuation that would be undertaken in response to such an emergency; and, finally, determining human health and environmental consequences due to the resulting radiation exposure. It concluded that there would be no detectable health effects or increase in cancer risk.

One peculiar feature of the RBMK design was that coolant failure could lead to a strong increase in power output from the fission process (positive void coefficient). However, this was not the prime cause of the Chernobyl accident.\\xa0It once and for all vindicated the desirability of designing with inherent safety supplemented by robust secondary safety provisions. By way of contrast to western safety engineering, the Chernobyl reactor did not have a containment structure like those used in the West or in post-1980 Soviet designs.The accident destroyed the reactor, and its burning contents dispersed radionuclides far and wide. This tragically meant that the results were severe, with 56 people killed, 28 of whom died within weeks from radiation exposure. It also caused radiation sickness in a further 200-300 staff and firefighters, and contaminated large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and beyond. It is estimated that at least 5% of the total radioactive material in the Chernobyl 4 reactor core was released from the plant, due to the lack of any containment structure. Most of this was deposited as dust close by. Some was carried by wind over a wide area.About 130,000 people received significant  ( _i.e._ above internationally accepted ICRP limits) and continue to be monitored. According to an UNSCEAR report in 2018, about 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed in 1991-2015 in patients who were 18 and under at the time of the accident. The report states that a quarter of the cases in 2001-2008 were \"probably\" due to high doses of radiation, and that this fraction was likely to have been higher in earlier years, and lower in later years. However, it also states that the uncertainty around the attributed fraction is very significant – at least 0.07 to 0.5\\xa0– and that the influence of annual screenings and active follow-up make comparisons with the general population problematic. Thyroid cancer is usually not fatal if diagnosed and treated early; the report states that of the diagnoses made between 1991 and 2005 (6,848 cases), 15 proved to be fatal. No increase in leukaemia or other cancers have yet shown up, but some is expected. The World Health Organization is closely monitoring most of those affected.The Chernobyl accident was a unique event and the only time in the history of commercial nuclear power that radiation-related fatalities occurred.\\xa0The main positive outcome of this accident for the industry was the formation of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), building on the US precedent.The destroyed unit 4 was enclosed in a concrete shelter, which was replaced by a more permanent structure in 2017.An OECD expert report on the accident concluded: \"The Chernobyl accident has not brought to light any new, previously unknown phenomena or safety issues that are not resolved or otherwise covered by current reactor safety programs for commercial power reactors in OECD member countries.\" In other words, the concept of \\'defence in depth\\' was conspicuous by its absence, and tragically shown to be vitally important.Apart from the RBMK reactor design, an early Russian PWR design, the VVER-440/V-230, gave rise to concerns in Europe, and a program was initiated to close these down as a condition of EU accession, along with Lithuania’s two RBMK units. See related papers on , and .However, after the US Atomic Energy Commission published General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants in 1971, Russian PWR designs conformed, according to Rosatom. In particular, the VVER-440/V-213 Loviisa reactors in Finland were designed at that time and modified to conform. The first of these two came on line in 1977.## A broader picture – other past accidentsThere have been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing reactor, including a number of core melts, but none of these has resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination. Elsewhere ( _Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors_ ) we tabulate these, along with the most serious commercial plant accidents. The list of ten probably corresponds to incidents rating level 4 or higher on today’s International Nuclear Event Scale (Table 4). All except Browns Ferry and Vandellos involved damage to or malfunction of the reactor core. At Browns Ferry a fire damaged control cables and resulted in an 18-month shutdown for repairs; at Vandellos a turbine fire made the 17-year old plant uneconomic to repair.Mention should be made of the accident to the US Fermi 1 prototype fast breeder reactor near Detroit in 1966. Due to a blockage in coolant flow, some of the fuel melted. However no radiation was released offsite and no-one was injured. The reactor was repaired and restarted but closed down in 1972.The well-publicized criticality accident at Tokai Mura, Japan, in 1999 was at a fuel preparation plant for experimental reactors, and killed two workers from radiation exposure. Many other such criticality accidents have occurred, some fatal, and practically all in military facilities prior to 1980. A review of these is listed in the _References_ section.In an uncontained reactor accident such as at Windscale (a military facility) in 1957 and at Chernobyl in 1986 (and to some extent Fukushima Daiichi in 2011), the principal health hazard is from the spread of radioactive materials, notably volatile fission products such as iodine-131 and caesium-137. These are biologically active, so that if consumed in food, they tend to stay in organs of the body. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days, so is a hazard for around the first month, (and apparently gave rise to the thyroid cancers after the Chernobyl accident). Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years, and is therefore potentially a long-term contaminant of pastures and crops. In addition to these, there is caesium-134 which has a half-life of about two years. While measures can be taken to limit human uptake of I-131, (evacuation of area for several weeks, iodide tablets), high levels of radioactive caesium can preclude food production from affected land for a long time. Other radioactive materials in a reactor core have been shown to be less of a problem because they are either not volatile (strontium, transuranic elements) or not biologically active (tellurium-132, xenon-133).Accidents in any field of technology provide valuable knowledge enabling incremental improvement in safety beyond the original engineering. Cars and airliners are the most obvious examples of this, but the chemical and oil industries can provide even stronger evidence. Civil nuclear power has greatly improved its safety in both engineering and operation over its 65 years of experience with very few accidents and major incidents to spur that improvement. The Fukushima Daiichi accident was the first since TMI in 1979 which will have significant implications, at least for older plants.## Scrams, seismic shutdownsA scram is a sudden reactor shutdown. When a reactor is scrammed, automatically due to seismic activity, or due to some malfunction, or manually for whatever reason, the fission reaction generating the main heat stops. However, considerable heat continues to be generated by the radioactive decay of the fission products in the fuel. Initially, for a few minutes, this is great\\xa0– about 7% of the pre-scram level. But it drops to about 1% of the normal heat output after two hours, to 0.5% after one day, and 0.2% after a week. Even then it must still be cooled, but simply being immersed in a lot of water does most of the job after some time. When the water temperature is below 100°C at atmospheric pressure the reactor is said to be in \"cold shutdown\".## European \\'stress tests\\' and US response following Fukushima accidentAspects of nuclear plant safety highlighted by the Fukushima accident were assessed in the nuclear reactors in the EU\\'s member states, as well as those in any neighbouring states that decided to take part. These comprehensive and transparent nuclear risk and safety assessments, the so-called \"stress tests\", involved targeted reassessment of each power reactor’s safety margins in the light of extreme natural events, such as earthquakes and flooding, as well as on loss of safety functions and severe accident management following any initiating event. They were conducted from June 2011 to April 2012. They mobilized considerable expertise in different countries (500 man-years) under the responsibility of each national Safety Authority within the framework of the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG).The Western European Nuclear Regulators\\' Association (WENRA) proposed these in response to a call from the European Council in March 2011, and developed specifications. WENRA is a network of Chief Regulators of EU countries with nuclear power plants and Switzerland, and has membership from 17 countries. It then negotiated the scope of the tests with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), an independent, authoritative expert body created in 2007 by the European Commission comprising senior officials from the national nuclear safety, radioactive waste safety or radiation protection regulatory authorities from all EU member states, and representatives of the European Commission.In June 2011 the governments of seven non-EU countries agreed to conduct nuclear reactor stress tests using the EU model. Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine signed a declaration that they would conduct stress tests and agreed to peer reviews of the tests by outside experts. Russia had already undertaken extensive checks. (Croatia is co-owner in the Krsko PWR in Slovenia, and Turkey is building its first nuclear plant.)The reassessment of safety margins is based on the existing safety studies and engineering judgement to evaluate the behaviour of a nuclear power plant when facing a set of challenging situations. For a given plant, the reassessment reports on the most probable behaviour of the plant for each of the situations considered. The results of the reassessment were peer-reviewed and shared among regulators. WENRA noted that it remains a national responsibility to take or order any appropriate measures, such as additional technical or organizational safety provisions,\\xa0resulting from the reassessment.The scope of the assessment took into account the issues directly highlighted by the events in Fukushima and the possibility for combination of initiating events. Two \\'initiating events\\' were covered in the scope: earthquake and flooding. The consequences of these –\\xa0loss of electrical power and station blackout, loss of ultimate heat sink and the combination of both – were analysed, with the conclusions being applicable to other general emergency situations. In accident scenarios, regulators consider power plants\\' means to protect against and manage loss of core cooling as well as cooling of used fuel in storage. They also study means to protect against and manage loss of containment integrity and core melting, including consequential effects such as hydrogen accumulation.Nuclear plant operators start by documenting each power plant site. This analysis of \\'extreme scenarios\\' followed what ENSREG called a progressive approach \"in which protective measures are sequentially assumed to be defeated\" from starting conditions which \"represent the most unfavourable operational states.\" The operators have to explain their means to maintain \"the three fundamental safety functions (control of reactivity, fuel cooling confinement of radioactivity)\" and support functions for these, \"taking into account the probable damage done by the initiating event.\"The documents had to cover provisions in the plant design basis for these events and the strength of the plant beyond its design basis. This means the \"design margins, diversity, redundancy, structural protection and physical separation of the safety relevant systems, structures and components and the effectiveness of the defence-in-depth concept.\" This had to focus on \\'cliff-edge\\' effects, e.g. when back-up batteries are exhausted and station blackout is inevitable. For severe accident management scenarios they must identify the time before fuel damage is unavoidable and the time before water begins boiling in used fuel ponds and before fuel damage occurs. Measures to prevent hydrogen explosions and fires are to be part of this.Since the licensee has the prime responsibility for safety, they performed the reassessments, and the regulatory bodies then independently reviewed them. The exercise covered 147 nuclear plants in 15 EU countries – including Lithuania with only decommissioned plants – plus 15 reactors in Ukraine and five in Switzerland.Operators reported to their regulators who then reported progress to the European Commission by the end of 2011. Information was shared among regulators throughout this process before the 17 final reports went to peer-review by teams comprising 80 experts appointed by ENSREG and the European Commission. The final documents were published in line with national law and international obligations, subject only to not jeopardising security – an area where each country could behave differently. The process was extended to June 2012 to allow more plant visits and to add more information on the potential effect of aircraft impacts.The European Commission adopted, with ENSREG, the final stress tests Report on April 26, 2012 and issued the same day a joint statement underlining the quality of the exercise. The full report and a summary of the 45 recommendations were published on . Drawing on the peer reviews, the EC and ENSREG cited four main areas for improving EU nuclear plant safety:- Guidance from WENRA for assessing natural hazards and margins beyond design basis.- Giving more importance to periodic safety reviews and evaluation of natural hazards.- Urgent measures to protect containment integrity.- Measures to prevent and mitigate accidents resulting from extreme natural hazards.The results of the stress tests pointed out, in particular, that European nuclear power plants offered a sufficient safety level to require no shutdown of any of them. At the same time, improvements were needed to enhance their robustness to extreme situations. In France, for instance, they were imposed by ASN requirements, which took into account exchanges with its European counterparts. A follow-up European action plan was established by ENSREG from July 2012.The EU process was completed at the end of September 2012, with the EU Energy Commissioner announcing that the stress tests had showed that the safety of European power reactors was generally satisfactory, but making some other comments and projections which departed from ENSREG. An EC report was presented to the EU Council in October 2012.In the USA the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in March 2012 made orders for immediate post-Fukushima safety enhancements, with a cost of about $100 million across the whole US fleet. The first order required the addition of equipment at all plants to help respond to the loss of all electrical power and the loss of the ultimate heat sink for cooling, as well as maintaining containment integrity. Another required improved water level and temperature instrumentation on used fuel ponds. The third order applied only to the 33 BWRs with early containment designs, and required \\'reliable hardened containment vents\\' which work under any circumstances. The US industry association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, told the NRC that licensees with these Mark I and Mark II containments “should have the capability to use various filtration strategies to mitigate radiological releases” during severe events, and that filtration “should be founded on scientific and factual analysis and should be performance-based to achieve the desired outcome.” All the measures are supported by the industry association, which also proposed setting up about six regional emergency response centres under NRC oversight with additional portable equipment.In Japan similar stress tests were carried out in 2011 under the previous safety regulator, but then reactor restarts were delayed until the newly constituted Nuclear Regulatory Authority devised and published new safety guidelines, then applied them progressively through the fleet.## Natural disasters### Earthquakes and volcanoesThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a _Safety Guide on Seismic Risks for Nuclear Power Plants_, and the matter is dealt with in the WNA page on .\\xa0Volcanic hazards are minimal for practically all nuclear plants, but the IAEA has developed a new Safety Guide on the matter. The Bataan plant in Philippines which has never operated, and the Armenian plant at Metsamor are two known to be in proximity to potential volcanic activity.### Flooding –\\xa0storms, tides and tsunamisNuclear plants are usually built close to water bodies, for the sake of cooling. The site licence takes account of worst case flooding scenarios as well as other possible natural disasters and, more recently, the possible effects of climate change. As a result, all the buildings with safety-related equipment are situated on high enough platforms so that they stand above submerged areas in case of flooding events. As an example, French Safety Rules criteria for river sites define the safe level as above a flood level likely to be reached with one chance in one thousand years, plus 15%, and similar regarding tides for coastal sites.Occasionally in the past some buildings have been sited too low, so that they are vulnerable to flood or tidal and storm surge, so engineered countermeasures have been built. EDF\\'s Blayais nuclear plant in western France uses seawater for cooling and the plant itself is protected from storm surge by dykes. However, in 1999 a 2.5 m storm surge in the estuary overtopped the dykes – which were already identified as a weak point and scheduled for a later upgrade – and flooded one pumping station. For security reasons it was decided to shut down the three reactors then under power (the fourth was already stopped in the course of normal maintenance). This incident was rated 2 on the INES scale.In 1994 the Kakrapar nuclear power plant near the west coast of India was flooded due to heavy rains together with failure of weir control for an adjoining water pond, inundating turbine building basement equipment. The back-up diesel generators on site enabled core cooling using fire water, a backup to process water, since the offsite power supply failed. Following this, multiple flood barriers were provided at all entry points, inlet openings below design flood level were sealed and emergency operating procedures were updated. In December 2004 the Madras NPP and Kalpakkam PFBR site on the east coast of India was flooded by a tsunami surge from Sumatra. Construction of the Kalpakkam plant was just beginning, but the Madras plant shut down safely and maintained cooling. However, recommendations including early warning system for tsunami and provision of additional cooling water sources for longer duration cooling were implemented.In March 2011 the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was affected seriously by a huge tsunami induced by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Three of the six reactors were operating at the time, and had shut down automatically due to the earthquake. The back-up diesel generators for those three units were then swamped by the tsunami. This cut power supply and led to weeks of drama and loss of the reactors. The design basis tsunami height was 5.7 m for Daiichi (and 5.2 m for adjacent Daini, which was actually set a bit higher above sea level). Tsunami heights coming ashore were about 14 metres for both plants. Unit 3 of Daini was undamaged and continued to cold shutdown status, but the other units suffered flooding to pump rooms where equipment transfers heat from the reactor circuit to the sea – the ultimate heat sink.The maximum amplitude of this tsunami was 23 metres at point of origin, about 160 km from Fukushima. In the last century there had been eight tsunamis in the Japan region with maximum amplitudes above 10 metres (some much more), these having arisen from earthquakes of magnitude 7.7 to 8.4, on average one every 12 years. Those in 1983 and in 1993 were the most recent affecting Japan, with maximum heights 14.5 metres and 31 metres respectively, both induced by magnitude 7.7 earthquakes. This 2011 earthquake was magnitude 9.For low-lying sites, civil engineering and other measures are normally taken to make nuclear plants resistant to flooding. Lessons from Blayais and Fukushima have fed into regulatory criteria. Sea walls have been and are being built or increased at Hamaoka, Shimane, Mihama, Ohi, Takahama, Onagawa, and Higashidori plants. However, few parts of the world have the same tsunami potential as Japan, and for the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe the maximum amplitude is much less than Japan.## HydrogenIn any light-water nuclear power reactor, hydrogen is formed by radiolytic decomposition of water. This needs to be dealt with to avoid the potential for explosion with oxygen present, and many reactors have been retrofitted with passive autocatalytic hydrogen recombiners in their containment, replacing external recombiners that needed to be connected and powered, isolated behind radiological barriers. Also in some kinds of reactor, particularly early boiling water types, the containment is rendered inert by injection of nitrogen.In an accident situation such as at Fukushima where the fuel became very hot, a lot of hydrogen is formed by the oxidation of zirconium fuel cladding in steam at about 1300°C. This is beyond the capability of the normal hydrogen recombiners to deal with,\\xa0and operators must rely on venting to atmosphere or inerting the containment with nitrogen.## International collaboration to improve safetyThere is a lot of international collaboration, but it has evolved from the bottom, and only in 1990s has there been any real top-down initiative. In the aviation industry the Chicago Convention in the late 1940s initiated an international approach which brought about a high degree of design collaboration between countries, and the rapid universal uptake of lessons from accidents. There are cultural and political reasons for this which mean that even the much higher international safety collaboration since the 1990s is still less than in aviation. See also paper on\\xa0, especially for fuller description of WANO, focused on operation.#### World Association of Nuclear OperatorsInternational cooperation on nuclear safety issues takes place under the auspices of the World Association of Nuclear Operators ( ) which was set up in 1989. In practical terms this is the most effective international means of achieving very high levels of safety through its four major programs: peer reviews; operating experience; technical support and exchange; and professional and technical development. WANO peer reviews are the main proactive way of sharing experience and expertise, and by the end of 2009 every one of the world\\'s commercial nuclear power plants had been peer-reviewed at least once. Following the Fukushima accident these have been stepped up to one every four years at each plant, with follow-up visits in between, and the scope extended from operational safety to include plant design upgrades. Pre-startup reviews of new plants are being increased.#### IAEA Convention on Nuclear SafetyThe IAEA  (CNS) was drawn up during a series of expert level meetings from 1992 to 1994 and was the result of considerable work by Governments, national nuclear safety authorities and the IAEA Secretariat. Its aim is to legally commit participating States operating land-based nuclear power plants to maintain a high level of safety by setting international benchmarks to which States would subscribe.The obligations of the Parties are based to a large extent on the principles contained in the IAEA Safety Fundamentals document _The Safety of Nuclear Installations_. These obligations cover for instance, siting, design, construction, operation, the availability of adequate financial and human resources, the assessment and verification of safety, quality assurance and emergency preparedness.The Convention is an incentive instrument. It is not designed to ensure fulfilment of obligations by Parties through control and sanction, but is based on their common interest to achieve higher levels of safety. These levels are defined by international benchmarks developed and promoted through regular meetings of the Parties. The Convention obliges Parties to report on the implementation of their obligations for international peer review.\\xa0This mechanism is the main innovative and dynamic element of the Convention. \\xa0Under the Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) program dating from 1982 international teams of experts conduct in-depth reviews of operational safety performance at a nuclear power plant. They review emergency planning, safety culture, radiation protection, and other areas. OSART missions are on request from the government, and involve staff from regulators, in these respects differing from WANO peer reviews.The Convention entered into force in October 1996. As of March 2021, there were 91 signatories to the Convention, 65 of which are contracting parties, including all countries with operating nuclear power plants.The IAEA General Conference in September 2011 unanimously endorsed the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that Ministers requested in June. The plan arose from intensive consultations with Member States but not with industry, and was described as both a rallying point and a blueprint for strengthening nuclear safety worldwide. It contains suggestions to make nuclear safety more robust and effective than before, without removing the responsibility from national bodies and governments. It aims to ensure \"adequate responses based on scientific knowledge and full transparency\". Apart from strengthened and more frequent IAEA peer reviews (including those of regulatory systems), most of the 12 recommended actions are to be undertaken by individual countries and are likely to be well in hand already.Following this, an extraordinary general meeting of 64 of the CNS parties in September 2012 gave a strong push to international collaboration in improving safety. National reports at future three-yearly CNS review meetings will cover a list of specific design, operational and organizational issues stemming from Fukushima lessons. They include further design features to avoid long-term offsite contamination and enhancement of emergency preparedness and response measures, including better definition of national responsibilities and improved international cooperation. Parties should also report on measures to \"ensure the effective independence of the regulatory body from undue influence.\"In February 2015 diplomats from 72 countries unanimously adopted the\\xa0, setting out “principles to guide them, as appropriate, in the implementation of the objective of the CNS to prevent accidents with radiological consequences and mitigate such consequences should they occur” but rejected Swiss amendments to the CNS as impractical. However, in line with Swiss and EU intentions, \"comprehensive and systematic safety assessments are to be carried out periodically and regularly for existing installations throughout their lifetime in order to identify safety improvements... Reasonably practicable or achievable safety improvements are to be implemented in a timely manner.\"#### IAEA design safety reviews and generic reactor safety reviewsAn IAEA design safety review (DSR) is performed at the request of a member state organization to evaluate the completeness and comprehensiveness of a reactor\\'s safety documentation by an international team of senior experts. It is based on IAEA published safety requirements. If the DSR is for a vendor’s design at the pre-licensing stage, it is done using the generic reactor safety review (GRSR) module. IAEA Safety Standards, applied in the DSR and GRSR at the fundamental and requirements level, are generic and apply to all nuclear installations. Therefore, it is neither intended nor possible to cover or substitute licensing activity, or to constitute any kind of design certification.DSRs have been undertaken in Armenia (2003, 2009), Bangladesh (2018), Bulgaria (2008), Pakistan (2006) and Ukraine (2008, 2009). GRSRs have been carried out on ACP100, ACP1000, ACPR-1000+, ACR1000, AES-2006, AP1000 (USA & UK), APR1000, APR1400, Atmea1, CAP1400, EPR, ESBWR, and VVER-TOI.#### Eastern Europe from 1980sIn relation to Eastern Europe particularly, since the late 1980s a major international program of assistance was carried out by the OECD, IAEA and Commission of the European Communities to bring early Soviet-designed reactors up to near western safety standards, or at least to effect significant improvements to the plants and their operation. The European Union also brought pressure to bear, particularly in countries which aspired to EU membership.Modifications were made to overcome deficiencies in the 11  still operating at the time in Russia. Among other things, these removed the danger of a positive void coefficient response. Automated inspection equipment has also been installed in these reactors.The other class of reactors which has been the focus of international attention for safety upgrades is the first-generation of pressurized water VVER-440 reactors. The V-230 model was designed before formal safety standards were issued in the Soviet Union and they lack many basic safety features. Two are still operating in Russia and one in Armenia, under close inspection.Later Soviet-designed reactors are very much safer and have Western control systems or the equivalent, along with containment structures.#### Europe since 1999The main European safety collaboration is through the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group ( ), an independent, authoritative expert body created in 2007 by the European Commission to revive the EU nuclear safety directive, which was passed in June 2009. It comprises senior officials from the national nuclear safety, radioactive waste safety or radiation protection regulatory authorities from all 27 EU member states, and representatives of the European Commission. It was preceded in 1999 by the Western European Nuclear Regulators\\' Association ( ), a network of Chief Regulators of EU countries with nuclear power plants and Switzerland, with membership from 17 countries.## Ageing of nuclear plants#### EngineeringSeveral issues arise in prolonging the lives of nuclear plants which were originally designed for nominal 30- or 40-year operating lives. Systems, structures and components (SSC) whose characteristics change gradually with time or use are the subject of attention, which is applied with vastly greater scientific and technical knowledge than that available to the original designers many decades ago.Some components simply wear out, corrode\\xa0or degrade to a low level of efficiency. These need to be replaced. Steam generators are the most prominent and expensive of these, and many have been replaced after about 30 years where the reactor otherwise has the prospect of running for 60 years. This is essentially an economic decision. Lesser components are more straightforward to replace as they age, and some may be safety-related as well as economic.In PHWR units, notably CANDU reactors, pressure tube replacement has been undertaken on some older plants, after some 30 years of operation.\\xa0Fuel channel integrity is another limiting factor for Candu reactors, and mid-life inspection and analysis can extend the original 175,000 full-power operating hours design assumption to 300,000 hours.A second issue is that of obsolescence. For instance, older reactors have analogue instrument and control systems, and a question must be faced regarding whether these are replaced with digital in a major mid-life overhaul, or simply maintained.Thirdly, the properties of materials may degrade with age, particularly with heat and neutron irradiation. In some early Russian pressurized water reactors, the pressure vessel is relatively narrow and is thus subject to greater neutron bombardment that a wider one. This raises questions of embrittlement, and has had to be checked carefully before extending licences.In some Russian and UK plants (RBMK, AGR), graphite is used as the moderator. The graphite blocks cannot be replaced during the operating life of the reactors. However, radiation damage changes the shape and size of the crystallites that comprise graphite, giving some dimensional change and degradation of the structural properties of the graphite. For continued operation, it is therefore necessary to demonstrate that the graphite can still perform its intended role irrespective of the degradation, or undergo some repair. In Russia, after dismantling the pressure tubes, longitudinal cutting of a limited number of deformed graphite columns returns the graphite stack geometry to a condition that meets the initial design requirements. Leningrad 1 was the first RBMK reactor to undergo this over 2012-13.In respect to all these aspects, periodic safety reviews are undertaken on most older plants in line with the IAEA safety convention and WANO\\'s safety culture principles to ensure that safety margins are maintained.\\xa0The IAEA undertakes Safety Aspects of Long-Term Operation (SALTO) evaluations of reactors on request from member countries. These SALTO missions check both physical and organizational aspects, and function as an international peer review of the national regulator.\\xa0They are backed up by the IAEA International Generic Ageing Lessons Learned (IGALL) program which is documented in databases and publications, in the form of downloadable safety guides and reports on ageing.Equipment performance is constantly monitored to identify faults and failures of components. Preventative maintenance is adapted and scheduled in the light of this, to ensure that the overall availability of systems important for both safety and plant availability are within the design basis, or better than the original design basis. Collecting reliability and performance data is of the utmost importance, as well as analysing them, for tracking indicators that might be signs of ageing, or indicative of potential problems having been under-estimated, or of new problems. The results of this monitoring and analysis are often shared Industry-wide through INPO and WANO networks. The use of probabilistic safety analysis makes possible risk-informed decisions regarding maintenance and monitoring programs, so that adequate attention is given to the health of every piece of equipment in the plant. This process is similar to that in other industries where safety is paramount, _e.g._ aviation. Reliability centred maintenance was adapted from civil aviation in the 1980s for instance, and led to nuclear industry review of existing maintenance programmes.In the USA most of the about 95 reactors are expected to be granted operating licence extensions from 40 to 60 years, with many to 80 years. This justifies significant capital expenditure in upgrading systems and components, including building in extra performance margins.#### Knowledge managementThe IAEA has a safety knowledge base for ageing and long-term operation of nuclear power plants (SKALTO) which aims to develop a framework for sharing information on ageing management and long term operation of nuclear power plants. It provides published documents and information related to this.Knowledge management in relation to the original design basis of reactors becomes an issue with corporate reorganization or demise of vendors, coupled with changes made over several decades. While operators usually have good records, some regulators do not. Design Basis Knowledge Management (DKM) is an issue receiving a lot of attention in the last ten years or so.Nuclear DKM addresses the specific needs of nuclear plants and organizations. Its scope extends from research and development, through design and engineering, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, refurbishment and long-term operation (LTO), waste management, to decommissioning. Nuclear DKM issues and priorities are often unique to the particular circumstances of individual countries and their regulators as well as other nuclear industry organizations. Nuclear DKM may focus on knowledge creation, identification, sharing, transfer, protection, validation, storage, dissemination, preservation or utilization. Nuclear DKM practices may enhance and support traditional business functions and goals such as human resource management, training, planning, operations, maintenance, and much more.There must always be a responsible owner of the DKM system for any plant. In most cases this will be the operator, however, based on a variety of changes such as market conditions, the responsible owner may change over time. An effective nuclear DKM system should be focused on strengthening and aligning the knowledge base in three primary knowledge domains in an organization: people, processes and technology, each of which must also be considered within the context of the organizational culture. Knowledge management policies and practices should help create a supportive organizational culture that recognizes the value of nuclear knowledge and promotes effective processes to maintain it.In Canada, the Pickering A – Bruce A saga is a cautionary tale (and classic industry case study) regarding DKM. By the mid-1990s there was a divergence between drawings and modifications which had progressively been made, and also the operating company had not shared operating experience with the designer. Maintenance standards fell and costs rose. A detailed audit in 1997-98 showed that the design basis was not being maintained and that 4000 additional staff would be required to correct the situation at all Ontario Hydro plants, so the two A plants (eight units) were shut down so that staff could focus on the 12 units not needing so much attention. From 2003, six of the eight A units were returned to service with design basis corrected, having been shut down for several years – a significant loss of asset base for the owners.## Reporting nuclear incidentsThe  (INES) was developed by the IAEA and OECD in 1990 to communicate and standardize the reporting of nuclear incidents or accidents to the public. The scale runs from a zero event with no safety significance to 7 for a \"major accident\" such as Chernobyl. TMI rated 5, as an \"accident with off-site risks\" though no harm to anyone, and a level 4 \"accident mainly in installation\" occurred in France in 1980, with little drama. Another accident rated at level 4 occurred in a  in Japan in September 1999.\\xa0 Other accidents have been in military plants .**The International Nuclear Event Scale**For prompt communication of safety significance| Level, Descriptor | Off-Site Impact, release of radioactive materials | On-Site Impact | Defence-in-Depth Degradation | Examples || --- | --- | --- | --- | --- || **7**<br>**Major Accident** | Major Release:<br> Widespread health and environmental effects |  |  | Chernobyl, Ukraine, 1986 (fuel meltdown and fire);\\xa0<br> Fukushima Daiichi 1-3, 2011 (fuel damage, radiation release and evacuation) || **6**<br>**Serious Accident** | Significant Release:<br> Full implementation of local emergency plans |  |  | Mayak at Ozersk, Russia, 1957 \\'Kyshtym\\' (reprocessing plant criticality) || **5**<br>**Accident with Off-Site Consequences** | Limited Release:<br> Partial implementation of local emergency plans, or | Severe damage to reactor core or to radiological barriers |  | Three Mile Island, USA, 1979 (fuel melting);<br> Windscale, UK, 1957 (military) || **4**<br>**Accident Mainly in Installation, with local consequences.**<br> either of: | Minor Release:<br> Public exposure of the order of prescribed limits, or | Significant damage to reactor core or to radiological barriers; worker fatality |  | Saint-Laurent A1, France, 1969 (fuel rupture) & A2 1980 (graphite overheating);<br> Tokai-mura, Japan, 1999 (criticality in fuel plant for an experimental reactor). || **3**<br>**Serious Incident**<br> any of: | Very Small Release:<br> Public exposure at a fraction of prescribed limits, or | Major contamination; Acute health effects to a worker, or | Near Accident:<br> Loss of Defence in Depth provisions - no safety layers remaining | Fukushima Daiichi 4, 2011 (fuel pond overheating);<br> Fukushima Daini 1, 2, 4, 2011 (interruption to cooling);\\xa0<br> Vandellos, Spain, 1989 (turbine fire);\\xa0<br> Davis-Besse, USA, 2002 (severe corrosion);<br> Paks, Hungary 2003 (fuel damage) || **2**<br>**Incident** | nil | Significant spread of contamination; Overexposure of worker, or | Incidents with significant failures in safety provisions |  || **1**<br>**Anomaly** | nil | nil | Anomaly beyond authorized operating regime |  || **0**<br>**Deviation** | nil | nil | No safety significance |  || Below Scale | nil | nil | No safety relevance |  |Source: International Atomic Energy Agency## Security – terrorism, etc.See also information page on .Since the World Trade Centre attacks in New York in 2001 there has been increased concern about the consequences of a large aircraft being used to attack a nuclear facility with the purpose of releasing radioactive materials. Various studies have looked at similar attacks on nuclear power plants. They show that nuclear reactors would be more resistant to such attacks than virtually any other civil installations – see\\xa0 A\\xa0\\xa0thorough study was undertaken by the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) using specialist consultants and paid for by the US Dept. of Energy. It concludes that US reactor structures \"are robust and (would) protect the fuel from impacts of large commercial aircraft\".The analyses used a fully-fuelled Boeing 767-400 of over 200 tonnes as the basis, at 560 km/h – the maximum speed for precision flying near the ground. The wingspan is greater than the diameter of reactor containment buildings and the 4.3 tonne engines are 15 metres apart. Hence analyses focused on single engine direct impact on the centreline – since this would be the most penetrating missile – and on the impact of the entire aircraft if the fuselage hit the centreline (in which case the engines would ricochet off the sides). In each case no part of the aircraft or its fuel would penetrate the containment. Other studies have confirmed these findings.Penetrating (even relatively weak) reinforced concrete requires multiple hits by high speed artillery shells or specially-designed \"bunker busting\" ordnance – both of which are well beyond what terrorists are likely to deploy. Thin-walled, slow-moving, hollow aluminium aircraft, hitting containment-grade heavily-reinforced concrete disintegrate, with negligible penetration. But further (see Sept 2002 _Science_ paper and Jan 2003 Response & Comments), realistic assessments from decades of analyses, lab work and testing, find that the consequence of even the worst realistic scenarios – core melting and containment failure – can cause few if any deaths to the public, regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment failure. This conclusion was documented in a 1981 EPRI study, reported and widely circulated in many languages, by Levenson and Rahn in _Nuclear Technology_.In 1988 Sandia National Laboratories in USA demonstrated the unequal distribution of energy absorption that occurs when an aircraft impacts a massive, hardened target. The test involved a rocket-propelled F4 Phantom jet (about 27 tonnes, with both engines close together in the fuselage) hitting a 3.7m thick slab of concrete at 765 km/h. This was to see whether a proposed Japanese nuclear power plant could withstand the impact of a heavy aircraft. It showed how most of the collision energy goes into the destruction of the aircraft itself – about 96% of the aircraft\\'s kinetic energy went into the its destruction and some penetration of the concrete – while the remaining 4% was dissipated in accelerating the 700-tonne slab. The maximum penetration of the concrete in this experiment was 60 mm, but comparison with fixed reactor containment needs to take account of the 4% of energy transmitted to the slab. See also .As long ago as the late 1970s, the UK Central Electricity Generating Board considered the possibility of a fully-laden and fully-fuelled large passenger aircraft being hijacked and deliberately crashed into a nuclear reactor. The main conclusions were that an airliner would tend to break up as it hit various buildings such as the reactor hall, and that those pieces would have little effect on the concrete biological shield surrounding the reactor. Any kerosene fire would also have little effect on that shield.\\xa0In the 1980s in the USA, at least some plants were designed to take a hit from a fully-laden large military transport aircraft and still be able to achieve and maintain cold shutdown.The study of a 1970s US power plant in a highly-populated area is assessing the possible effects of a successful terrorist attack which causes both meltdown of the core and a large breach in the containment structure – both extremely unlikely. It shows that a large fraction of the most hazardous radioactive isotopes, like those of iodine and tellurium, would never leave the site.Much of the radioactive material would stick to surfaces inside the containment or becomes soluble salts that remain in the damaged containment building. Some radioactive material would nonetheless enter the environment some hours after the attack in this extreme scenario and affect areas up to several kilometres away. The extent and timing of this means that with walking-pace evacuation inside this radius it would not be a major health risk. However it could leave areas contaminated and hence displace people in the same way as a natural disaster, giving rise to economic rather than health consequences.Looking at spent fuel storage pools, similar analyses showed no breach. Dry storage and transport casks retained their integrity. \"There would be no release of radionuclides to the environment\".Similarly, the massive structures mean that any terrorist attack even inside a plant (which are well defended) and causing loss of cooling, core melting and breach of containment would not result in any significant radioactive releases.However, while the main structures are robust, the 2001 attacks did lead to increased security requirements and plants were required by NRC to install barriers, bulletproof security stations and other physical modifications which in the USA are estimated by the industry association to have cost some $2 billion across the country.See also  2002 and .Switzerland\\'s Nuclear Safety Inspectorate studied a similar scenario and reported in 2003 that the danger of any radiation release from such a crash would be low for the older plants and extremely low for the newer ones.The conservative design criteria which caused most power reactors to be shrouded by massive containment structures with biological shield has provided peace of mind in a suicide terrorist context. Ironically and as noted earlier, with better understanding of what happens in a core melt accident inside, they are now seen to be not nearly as necessary in that accident mitigation role as was originally assumed.## Advanced reactor designsThe designs for nuclear plants being developed for implementation in coming decades contain numerous safety improvements based on operational experience. The first two of these\\xa0 began operating in Japan in 1996.One major feature they have in common (beyond safety engineering already standard in Western reactors) is passive safety systems, requiring no operator intervention in the event of a major malfunction.The main metric used to assess reactor safety is the likelihood of the core melting due to loss of coolant. These new designs are one or two orders of magnitude less likely than older ones to suffer a core melt accident, but the significance of that is more for the owner and operator than the neighbours, who –\\xa0as TMI and Fukushima showed – are safe also with older types.## Safety relative to other energy sourcesMany occupational accident statistics have been generated over the last 40 years of nuclear reactor operations in the US and UK. These can be compared with those from coal-fired power generation. All show that nuclear is a distinctly safer way to produce electricity.**Deaths from energy-related accidents per unit of electricity**![]( TW.yr is the amount of electricity used by the world in about five months.Coal-fired power generation has chronic, rather than acute, safety implications for public health. It also has profound safety implications for the mining of coal, with hundreds of workers killed each year in coal mines (see Appendix).Hydro power generation has a record of few but very major events causing thousands of deaths. In 1975 when the Banqiao, Shimantan & other dams collapsed in Henan, China, at least 30,000 people were killed immediately and some 230,000 overall, with 18 GWe lost. In 1979 and 1980 in India some 3500 were killed by two hydro-electric dam failures, and in 2009 in Russia 75 were killed by a hydro power plant turbine disintegration.\\xa0Early in 2017 nearly 200,000 people were evacuated due to the potential failure of the Oroville Dam in California.Significant energy-related accidents are quoted in the\\xa0. \\xa0A major reason for coal\\'s unfavourable showing is the huge amount which must be mined and transported to supply even a single large power station. Mining and multiple handling of so much material of any kind involves hazards, and these are reflected in the statistics.In the UK, Friends of the Earth commissioned a study by the Tyndall Centre, which drew primarily on peer-reviewed academic literature, supplemented by literature from credible government, consultancy and policy sources. It concluded in January 2013 that “Overall the safety risks associated with nuclear power appear to be more in line with lifecycle impacts from renewable energy technologies, and significantly lower than for coal and natural gas per MWh of supplied energy.”* * *## Notes & references#### General sourcesBall, Roberts & Simpson, Research Report #20, Centre for Environmental & Risk Management, University of East Anglia, 1994IAEA 2005, Chernobyl Forum report: Chernobyl\\'s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic ImpactsIAEA 1997, Sustainable Development and Nuclear PowerPaul Scherrer Institut 2001, Severe Accidents in the Energy SectorTwilley R C, Framatome ANP\\'s SWR1000 reactor design, Nuclear News, Sept 2002EPRI Dec 2002 report Deterring Terrorism: Aircraft Crash Impact Analyses Demonstrate Nuclear Power Plant\\'s Structural Strength on NEI websiteChapin D.M., Levenson M., Pate Z.P., Rockwell T et al 2002, Nuclear Power Plants and their Fuel as terrorist Targets, Science, Sept 2002; with Letters & Response, Science 10 Jan 2003Levenson, M. & Rahn, F. 1981, Realistic Estimates of the Consequences of Nuclear Accidents, Nuclear Technology 53:99-110, ANS, May 1981Stoiber, Carl 2007, World Nuclear University Summer InstituteOECD Nuclear Energy Agency 2010, Comparing Nuclear Accident Risks with those from other energy sources.

The Nuclear Safety Review 2023 reflects the global trends in 2022. It shows that the nuclear community continued to make steady progress in improving nuclear safety throughout the world. It also presents planned Agency activities for 2023 and priorities, as identified by the Agency, for strengthening nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, and emergency preparedness and response (EPR). Agency activities undertaken in 2022 can be found in Appendix A. The Agency’s safety standards activities in 2022 are provided in Appendix B.![]( Safety Priorities·Continuing to strengthenthe Agency'ssafety standardsto ensure thatthey constitutean integrated,comprehensiveand consistent set ofup-to-date, user-friendlyandfit-for-purposestandardsofhighqualityandthatthey continue to be seenasthe global reference forprotecting people andthe environmentfromtheharmful effectsof ionizing radiation; ·Encouraging political commitmenttothe Code of Conductonthe Safetyand SecurityofRadioactive Sourcesand itssupplementary Guidance.The Agency willactivelyinteractwithMemberStatestoencouragepoliticalandpractical commitmenttotheCodeandtheGuidance.Theobjectiveisto getallMember Statestoparticipateinit,promoteitand observeitsrecommendations; ·HostingtheJoint EighthandNinthReviewMeeting of the ContractingParties to the CNS; ·ContinuingtoassistMemberStatesinstrengtheningtheirEPRcapabilities throughtheimplementationof IAEASafetyStandardsSeriesNo.GSR Part7，the deliveryofcapacitybuildingactivities,andthe implementation oftherecommendationsandactionitemsfromthe11thMeetingofthe Representativesof CompetentAuthorities ldentified underthe Early Notification Conventionand the Assistance Convention; ·Enhancing thesustainability of Agency regionaland thematicnetworksthrough thedevelopmentand implementationofself-assessmenttoolsfornetworks andby enhancing the interactionsbetween differentregional networks;2. The Executive Overview provides a summary of significant nuclear safety issues and trends covered in this period of reporting.3. The work on the Agency’s safety standards continued to focus on the revision of existing standards rather than the establishment of new ones. Two General Safety Guides and 15 Specific Safety Guides were published in 2022.4. Broader analysis of peer review and advisory service mission reports shows that these continue to include recommendations relating to leadership, safety management, occupational radiation protection and safety culture.5.

Many Member States that are considering embarking on a nuclear power programme or on a first research reactor project face difficulties in allocating resources for regulatory capacity building. The Integrated Regulatory Review Service, the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR)1 and other peer review and advisory services undertaken in embarking countries continue to identify the need to strengthen regulatory body independence, build regulatory capacity and competence, and establish safety regulations and licensing processes as part of effective legislative and regulatory oversight programmes.![]( The Agency will:General Safety·Strengthen its safety standardsand assist withtheir application;·Promoteadherenceto Conventionsunder itsauspicesand supporttheir implementation;·AssistMemberStatesinstrengtheningtheirregulatoryeffectiveness;·AssistMember States in strengthening leadershipandmanagementfor safety;·AssistMember States instrengtheningtheir processesforcommunicating radiation risks;·AssistMemberStates intheir capacitybuildingprogrammes;and·AssistMemberStates'effortsinthefield of researchand developmentfor safety.7. There is continued Member State interest in building and further developing their national systems for EPR, including risk assessment, the use of dose projection tools, and effective communication. Member States continue to seek Agency support in improving the preparation, conduct and evaluation of national emergency exercises.8. In 2022, the number of Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management increased by two, while there was no increase in the number of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS).9. In 2022, one further Member State2 became Party to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident (Early Notification Convention), while three further Member States3 became Parties to the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Assistance Convention). By the end of 2022, 40 States Parties to the Assistance Convention had registered National Assistance Capabilities in the Agency’s Response and Assistance Network, of which three States Parties4 to the Assistance Convention registered National Assistance Capabilities this year.![]( andResponse# The Agency will:·Furtherdevelopandsupportthe implementationoftheoperational arrangementsfornotification,reportingand assistance; ·AssistMemberStates inthe implementationof IAEA Safety StandardsSeries No.GSRPart7anddevelopassociated Safety Guides;and ·Continue to implement an active exercise programmeatthe international level totest EPRand supportnational EPRexercise programmes.10. There is growing Member State interest in the identification and characterization of areas contaminated by past activities or events and in planning for remediation and post-remediation management of sites. There is also Member State interest in sharing experiences of successful remediation projects. Member States continue to request Agency assistance in remediation activities.11. International attention continues to be paid to the handling of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP).12. There is increasing interest in Member States in the recording and analysis of the radiological impact on people and the environment from regulated discharges from facilities and activities and due to residual radioactive materials that derives from past unregulated practices or abnormal situations. Agency programmes — such as the Database on Discharges of Radionuclides to the Atmosphere and Aquatic Environment for discharges and the Methods for Radiological and Environmental Impact Assessment programme for exchanging experience regarding radiological assessment methodologies — are responding to this interest.13. Access to and use of diagnostic imaging procedures utilizing ionizing radiation is growing, leading to higher cumulative individual exposures in Member States and creating a need for greater awareness of the importance of justification of medical exposures and optimization of radiation protection of patients.14. The intensive use of radioactive sources in medicine, agriculture, industry and research has led to a growing number of disused radioactive sources that require safe and secure management and disposal. Member States require further guidance on the application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources with regard to ensuring financial provisions for the safe management and secure protection of disused radioactive sources. The number of Member States committed to acting in a harmonized manner with the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources is 128, and the number of States that have committed themselves to implementing the supplementary Guidance on the Management of Disused Radioactive Sources grew to 50 in 2022.15. The need for capacity in Member States for the release of material and waste from regulatory control has increased. Requests continue for Agency support for safe interim and long term management solutions for radioactive waste. Disposal is the safe long term management solution for waste. The Agency’s Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management, Decommissioning and Remediation peer review service continues to be in demand.![]( The Agency will:Strengthening Radiation,Transprt and Waste Safety·AssistMember Statesinthe management of radioactive sources;·Promote the application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security ofRadioactive Sourcesandthe supplementary Guidance on the Importand Exportof Radioactive Sourcesand Guidanceonthe Management of Disused RadioactiveSources;·AssistMemberStatesindevelopingand implementingnational policiesand strategies forthe safemanagementofradioactivewasteand spentfuel, including disposal,andthedevelopment of decommissioning strategiesand plans;·Promoteand facilitate the sharing of experience regarding the remediationof contaminatedareasand;·Conduct technical reviews,upon request,of Member State activities.16. Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) mission reports continue to identify recommendations and suggestions with regard to strengthening the conduct of safe operations, enhancing continuous improvement, optimizing maintenance activities, strengthening accident management and on-site EPR, and setting, communicating and implementing management expectations.17. Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation (SALTO) missions continue to identify the need to improve the preparedness of NPPs for long term operation (LTO), specifically in the areas of safety assessments, including ageing management, knowledge management and competence management. Member States are increasingly using periodic safety reviews to justify the LTO of NPPs and have expressed interest in sharing current challenges, good practices and examples of corrective actions and resultant safety improvements.18. Member States are continuing to request Site and External Events Design (SEED) missions, as well as other capacity building services related to this subject.19. Member States continue to revise severe accident management guidance for existing NPPs to include safety upgrades and non-permanent equipment, and to address multi-unit considerations.20. The application of Agency safety standards to innovative NPP designs, including small modular reactors (SMRs), is a matter of great interest for Member States. The construction and deployment of transportable NPPs (TNPPs) is also of increasing interest to Member States.21. More than 80 different designs of SMR are at various stages of development and some SMR concepts are close to deployment. Several Member States are considering requesting Technical Safety Review (TSR) services for SMR designs.22. In response to the growing interest of Member States in the utilization of advanced new reactor technologies, the Agency developed the IAEA Platform on Small Modular Reactors and their Applications (SMR Platform). In addition, the Agency launched the Nuclear Harmonization and Standardization Initiative (NHSI), which reflects Member States’ interest in the harmonization of safety requirements and regulatory and licensing approaches as well as in the standardization of industrial approaches for SMRs. Furthermore, some Member States expressed an interest in applying a holistic approach to safety–security–safeguards by design for nuclear installations, in particular for SMRs, in the early stage of the design process without prejudice to Member States’ legal commitments, the Agency’s Statute and the relevant General Conference resolutions.23. Most Member States with operating research reactors are applying the provisions of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors.24. Analysis of reports provided to the Fuel Incident Notification and Analysis System (FINAS) in 2022 showed the importance of establishing effective ageing management programmes, continued training of personnel, and effective use of operating procedures.![]( SafetyinNuclear Installations# TheAgency will:·AssistMember States in implementing programmes forageing management andthe longtermoperation;·Facilitate the exchange of operating experience;·Provide assistance to Member Statesto supporttheir preparation for implementationofsafetyupgrades;·AssistMemberStateactivitiesrelatedtosmallandmediumsizedormodular reactors;·Strengthentheapplication of the Code of Conductonthe Safety of Research Reactors;and·AssistMember Statesinthe development of safety infrastructures fornew nuclearpowerand research reactorprogrammes.25. Member States continue to attach importance to having in place effective and coherent nuclear liability mechanisms at the national and international levels. Member States continue to request Agency assistance for their efforts to adhere to and implement the international nuclear liability conventions.26. Member States encourage the Secretariat to continue identification of synergies and interfaces between nuclear safety and nuclear security and further development of guidance on how to effectively address them.![]( FOCUS AREASImprovingManagementoftheSafetyandSecurityInterfaceAndStrengthening CivilLiabilityfor NuclearDamage# TheAgencywill:·Ensure thatsafetystandardsand nuclearsecurity guidance take intoaccount theimplicationsforboth safetyand securitywheneverappropriate,recognizing thattheactivitiesthataddressnuclearsafetyand securityare different;and ·Continueto facilitatetheestablishmentofa globalnuclearliabilityregime andassistMemberStatesintheireffortstoadheretoandimplement theinternationalnuclear liabilityinstruments,taking intoaccountthe recommendationsadoptedbyINLEXin2012.27. The Agency’s priorities for 2023 regarding strengthening nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, and EPR, are as follows:Continuing to strengthen the Agency’s safety standards to ensure that they constitute an integrated, comprehensive and consistent set of up-to-date, user-friendly and fit-forpurpose standards of high quality and that they continue to be seen as the global reference for protecting people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation; Encouraging political commitment to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and its supplementary Guidance.

The Secretariat, together with Member States, is working on the establishment of a long term strategy for the future development of safety standards, addressing the set of safety standards in a holistic manner and ensuring coordination with relevant international organizations.![]( The Agency’s peer review and advisory services continue to be provided to Member States upon request, and the number of Member State requests for these services remains high (see Figure 1).![]( 1. Number of Member State requests for Agency peer review and advisory services to be conducted over the next two# Related activities3. The Agency will continue strengthening its safety standards using lessons from international conferences and other relevant sources. The Agency will assist with the application of its safety standards by, inter alia, strengthening its peer review and advisory services and related selfassessment tools. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Further optimize the process for the development of safety standards, including improving the operational website used by the Safety Standards Committees and the Commission on Safety Standards, and consolidate the long term strategy for their future development;Review the safety standards for their applicability to small and medium sized or modular reactors (SMRs) and larger non-water cooled reactors and update them accordingly;Continue encouraging Member States to request Agency peer review and advisory services to strengthen their operational safety performance and leadership and management for safety; Continue providing Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) missions according to the recommended ten-year cycle, including IRRS follow-up missions, and continue encouraging Member States to request these missions;Encourage Member States to request Technical Safety Review (TSR) services concerning the safety of conceptual reactor designs for SMRs to increase confidence in the safety of their designs or the adequacy of their safety assessments, as well as to identify the path to implement practicable improvements to nuclear safety;Continue strengthening Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) missions by extending the pool of experts serving as reviewers, facilitating the self-assessment process using the Emergency Preparedness and Response Information Management System (EPRIMS), increasing transparency of findings, and making consistent use of performance indicators to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of missions; andContinue encouraging Member States to request Occupational Radiation Protection Appraisal Service (ORPAS) missions to strengthen their legislative and regulatory infrastructure and their practical implementation of occupational radiation protection programmes.# A.2. International Safety Conventions# Trends4. The Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) was adopted on 17 June 1994 and entered into force on 24 October 1996. As of December 2022, there were 91 Contracting Parties to the CNS (see Figure 2).![]( 2. Number of Contracting Parties to the CNS between 2018 and 2022.5. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (Joint Convention) was adopted on 5 September 1997 and entered into force on 18 June 2001. As of December 2022, there were 88 Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention, an increase of 2 compared to the end of 2021 (see Figure 3).![]( 3. Number of Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention between 2018 and 2022.6. The Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident (Early Notification Convention) was adopted on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 27 October 1986. As of December 2022, there were 132 States Parties to the Early Notification Convention, an increase of 1 compared to the end of 2021.7. The Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Assistance Convention) was adopted on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 26 February 1987. As of December 2022, there were 127 States Parties to the Assistance Convention, an increase of 3 compared to the end of 2021.# Related Activities8. The Agency will promote universal adherence to the CNS, Joint Convention, Early Notification Convention and Assistance Convention, and support their effective implementation, inter alia through the organization of workshops at the regional level and through bilateral activities with the Member States. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Organize the Joint Eighth and Ninth Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the CNS;Continue promoting the adherence of Member States to international safety conventions; Provide educational workshops for Contracting Parties to ensure effective implementation of the CNS;Organize regional and interregional workshops to promote the adherence of Member States to the Joint Convention; andImplement the actions adopted at the 11th Meeting of the Representatives of Competent Authorities Identified under the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention, which aim to strengthen emergency preparedness and response (EPR) in Member States.# A.3. Regulatory Effectiveness in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport and Waste Safety, and in Emergency Preparedness and Response# Trends9. Information provided in the Agency’s Radiation Safety Information Management System (RASIMS)5 indicates that $80 %$ of Member States whose information in the system has been evaluated have a regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety with a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘good’ level of compliance with Agency safety standards.10. The 13 IRRS missions conducted in 2022 highlighted the continued commitment of the Member States concerned to strengthening national legal and governmental infrastructure. The Agency’s ongoing analysis of IRRS missions conducted since 2015 shows that many regulatory bodies still experience issues with maintaining regulations for occupational and medical exposure; reviewing and testing emergency plans; long term human resource planning; financial resources; management systems; and the implementation of a graded approach to regulatory processes, including authorization and inspection.11. There is increasing interest from Member States in the assessment of their radioactive waste and spent fuel management, decommissioning and remediation programmes, as demonstrated by the number of requests for Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management, Decommissioning and Remediation (ARTEMIS) missions. Ten ARTEMIS missions were conducted in 2022 and nine are planned for 2023 concerning Member States’ radioactive waste management programmes.12. Member States are showing increasing interest in performing self-assessments against the requirements of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 7 (Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency), using EPRIMS. Data indicates that $1 5 %$ of Member States conducted or updated one of their self-assessments against GSR Part 7 in 2022.13. Member States, at the Transport Safety Standards Committee, concluded their review of the 2018 edition of the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR-6 (Rev. 1)) and requested the Secretariat to initiate its revision.# GC(67)/INF/2Page 14# There is...![]( commitmentto strengthening national legaland governmental infrastructure;·Continued interestamongmanyMemberStatesinupdatingnational EPRframeworks,including EPR regulations,and harmonizing national arrangements;and·Continuedinterestin ARTEMiSmissions.RegulatoryEffectiveness inNuclear,RadiationTransportandWaste Safety, andinEmergencyPreparednessandResponse# There are...Issuesinrelationtolongtermhumanresourceplans,themanagementsystem andthe implementationofthe gradedapproachwithinregulatoryprocesses.# Need for...·Training forRPOsand qualifiedexperts,and extension ofthemonitoringscopeof technical serviceproviderstostrengthenoccupational radiation protection;and ·Discussionof the effectiveness of nuclearand radiationregulatory systems atanInternational ConferenceonEffective Nuclearand RadiationRegulatory Systems:PreparingfortheFutureinaRapidlyChangingEnvironment.# Related Activities14.

The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Organize the International Conference on Effective Nuclear and Radiation Regulatory Systems: Preparing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Environment, the sixth in a series of conferences on effective nuclear and radiation regulatory systems; andOrganize workshops on the lessons identified from IRRS missions.# A.4. Leadership and Management for Safety, Safety Culture and Communication on Safety# Trends15. Member States’ interest in the Agency’s regional networks and thematic networks under the Global Nuclear Safety and Security Network (GNSSN) framework continues to increase. 16. Agency peer review and advisory service mission reports continue to include recommendations relating to leadership, safety management, occupational radiation protection and safety culture. 17. The number of requests from Member States for assistance in conducting safety culture selfassessments for regulatory bodies remains high. The number of requests for the International School of Nuclear and Radiological Leadership for Safety also remains high. 18. Thematic working groups and Technical Meetings have highlighted the need for the Secretariat to further support Member States in developing communication strategies and plans.·Reviewandadvisory servicemissionreportscontinuetoinclude recommendationsrelatingtoleadership,safetymanagement,occupational radiationprotectionandsafetyculture;and·MemberStatescontinuetorequestassistance indeveloping their programmes onleadershipandsafetymanagement.![]( Need for...·TheSecretariattofurther supportMemberStatesindevelopingcommunication strategiesandplans;and ·Supportforknowledgenetworkingactivitiesunderthe GNSSN.# Related Activities19. The Agency will assist Member States in strengthening leadership and management for the safety of nuclear and radiation facilities and activities. The Agency will assist Member States in their efforts to foster and sustain a strong safety culture. The Agency will also assist Member States in strengthening their processes for communicating radiation risks to the public in planned and existing exposure situations and during an emergency. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Hold a Technical Meeting on Experience in Development of Leadership and Safety Culture Programmes in Member States;Hold a training course on Leadership, Management and Culture for Safety and on the Safety Culture Continuous Improvement Process; andContinue to implement the International Schools of Nuclear and Radiological Leadership for Safety.# A.5. Capacity Building in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport and Waste Safety, and in Emergency Preparedness and Response# Trends20. Member States continue to express a need for Agency support as they develop and strengthen their national provisions for education, training, qualification and competence in radiation protection, in order to achieve closer alignment with Agency safety standards.21. Member States have provided information on the current status of their national provisions in order to identify areas where these should be strengthened and they have evaluated the education and training needs at the national level, particularly for personnel with responsibilities for radiation protection and safety (radiation protection officers (RPOs) and qualified experts).22. The Postgraduate Educational Course (PGEC) in Radiation Protection and the Safety of Radiation Sources continued to be an effective programme through which Member States can train personnel with regulatory or advisory functions in radiation safety. An increasing number of Member States are showing interest in hosting the course, under the auspices of the Agency, for the benefit of other Member States at the regional level.# GC(67)/INF/2Page 16PostgraduateEducational Course(PGEC) in RadiationProtection and theSafety of Radiation SourcesFirstheld:1981 in ArgentinaObjective:Toprovidea soundbasis inradiationprotectionandthesafety ofradiationsources.Includesboththeoreticaland practicaltrainingon themultidisciplinaryscientificandtechnicalfoundationsofinternational recommendationsandstandardsonradiationprotectionandtheir implementation.Number ofparticipants since 1981:2067Moreinformation: 600 hours 10 Regional 5 UN languages distributed Training plus over20weeks Centres Portuguese23. In general, Member States’ interest in online and web-based training on radiation protection — including radiation protection in medical uses of ionizing radiation, occupational radiation protection, radon, transport and waste safety — which had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions of previous years, has remained high. Member States are also showing increasing interest in accessing e-learning resources on Agency safety standards and on their practical application, as well as in participating in knowledge management networks where they can share their experience of the application of the safety standards in national and international projects.24. Reports provided by Member States to the Steering Committee on Regulatory Capacity Building and Knowledge Management show the timely implementation of the strategic approach to capacity building in nuclear safety. The work programme of the Steering Committee and the activities of the Secretariat remain on track.25. There was an increase in the number of requests for support for education and training activities related to site evaluation and operational safety performance of nuclear installations, in particular SMRs, design safety and safety assessment, protection against external events, design extension conditions, severe accident management, long term operation (LTO) and safety culture. Such requests arrive from Member States with existing nuclear installations as well as from those considering embarking on nuclear power programmes. There was also an increase in the number of requests for support for training on safety assessment computational tools, probabilistic safety assessment, severe accident management guidelines, drafting of regulations, inspector training, and senior manager leadership and safety culture from Member States embarking on new nuclear power programmes.26. Many Member States considering embarking on a nuclear power programme or on a first research reactor project are facing difficulties in allocating resources for regulatory capacity building. In many of these Member States, the programme or project schedules allow only limited time for the regulatory body to establish its resources and competence to perform its regulatory functions effectively.27. Member State interest in EPR capacity building activities has continued to grow. The International Network for Education and Training for Emergency Preparedness and Response membership grew to 206 in 2022, up from 179 in 2021. Young graduates have shown interest in the opportunity to upgrade their qualifications in EPR: in 2022, the second year of the international master’s degree programme in EPR following its pilot implementation in 2021, 3 graduates applied to join the programme.![]( Statescontinue torequest Agency supportasthey developand strengthentheirnational provisionsforeducation,training,qualificationand competence inradiationprotectionand safety，inordertoachievecloser alignmentwithAgencysafetystandards.Capacity Building inNuclear,Radiation,Transportand Waste Safety,and in EmergencyPreparedness and Response# There is...·Anincrease inthe numberof requestsforsupport foreducationand trainingactivitiesrelatedtositeevaluationandoperationalsafetyofnuclear installations,designsafetyprotectionagainstexternal events,design extensionconditions,severeaccidentmanagement,LTOandsafetyculture fromMember Stateswithexistingnuclear installationsandthoseconsidering embarkingonnuclearpowerprogrammes;·Anincrease inthenumberof requests forsupportfortraining onsafety assessmentcomputationaltools,probabilisticsafetyassessment,severe accidentmanagementguidelines,draftingofregulations,inspectortraining andseniormanagerleadershipandsafetyculture fromMemberStates embarkingonnewnuclearpowerprogrammes;and·Agrowing interest inonlineandweb-basedtrainingonradiationprotection.# Need for...Developingorstrengtheningnationalandorganizationalknowledgemanagement programmesandcapacitybuildingfornuclearsafetyamongregulatorybodies, operators,aswell astechnical and scientificsupport organizations.# Related Activities28. The Agency will assist Member States in their capacity building programmes, in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety as well as EPR, and will assist Member States in developing their expertise in the relevant technical areas. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Support Member States in the development and strengthening of provisions for education, training, qualification and competence in radiation protection and safety, and on the establishment of national strategies in this area; Continue enhancing, including by virtual methods, education and training programmes and implementing capacity building activities in the areas of safety assessment and design safety, and operational safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs);?

Research and Development for Safety# Trends29. Much of the recent research and development work undertaken in Member States focused on severe accident phenomena and safety features for design extension conditions to ensure the practical elimination of conditions that can lead to early or large radioactive release should an accident occur.30. Member States continue to show high interest in research related to EPR, including in the effective use of dose projection tools, as demonstrated by their participation in and contribution to a coordinated research project on this topic.31. There is increased interest in Member States in the application of rapid characterization techniques for radiological contamination based on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with radiation detectors.# Related Activities# 32. The Agency will assist Member State efforts in the field of research and development for safety where the need for further work has been identified, and will facilitate the exchange of results. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Continue to encourage research and development on the basis of identified needs, particularly regarding advanced approaches in safety assessment, analysis of design extension conditions, new design features, and equipment qualification in severe accident conditions;Continue to conduct research and development activities in support of the safety of advanced/innovative reactors, including carrying out the study on the applicability of Agency safety standards to accident tolerant fuels; andOrganize training on the application of rapid characterization techniques based on the use of UAVs equipped with radiation detectors.# B. Strengthening Radiation, Transport and Waste SafetyB.1. Radiation Protection of Patients, Workers and the Public# Trends33. There is continued interest and awareness among Member States, including through Agency activities regarding naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), concerning the need to protect workers and properly manage residues in industrial operations and processes involving NORM, and to apply a graded approach to the use of regulatory and operator resources for these tasks in line with the International Basic Safety Standards (IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3).34. Member States continue to request Agency guidance as to how to consistently apply the requirements of GSR Part 3 relating to existing exposure situations to the entire, varied range of activities considered to be existing exposure situations. The application of a graded approach remains challenging for Member States dealing with regulatory control of existing exposure situations, such as in the context of international trade of commodities and criteria for exemption of surface-contaminated non-food commodities.35. High rates of participation in Agency activities and feedback from Member States both indicate a growing awareness among Member States of the effects of exposure due to radon in homes and workplaces and the need for the Agency to provide assistance in this field.36. The Agency has issued guidance on how to manage exposures due to radionuclides in food and drinking water in non-emergency situations. Member States’ requests to promote discussion and potential application of the recently released guidance confirm this to be a subject of significant concern.37. Member States continue to request assistance in establishing regulatory systems for the application of non-medical human imaging, the use of consumer products and the management of nonfood commodities containing radionuclides.38. The magnitude of recurrent radiological imaging of patients and the associated higher cumulated individual exposures have been shown to be more extensive than previously assumed. Interventional radiology procedures are rapidly becoming more frequent around the world, posing many additional challenges in terms of the radiation protection of patients and medical staff, including the risk of tissue reactions such as skin injuries for patients and eye lens opacities for staff. The number of radiotherapy treatment courses delivered per year globally is also increasing. Radiation protection and safety are of particular concern when this technology is introduced in countries and regions that have previously had only limited access to such applications.·Magnitudeofrecurrentradiological imagingandtheassociatedhigher exposurearemoreextensivethanpreviouslyknown;·Application of graded approachto regulating existing exposure situations remainsachallenge;and·GrowingawarenessamongMember Statesofthe health effectsof exposure to radonin homesand workplaces.![]( Need for...·Revised guidanceregardingtheapplicationof regulatoryflexibilityinexemptio andclearance;and·Protection ofworkersand propermanagement of residuesin industrial processes involvingNORM.# Related Activities39. The Agency will assist Member States in the application of the Agency’s safety standards, in particular the International Basic Safety Standards (GSR Part 3), in radiation protection of people and the environment for applications such as waste management, transport of radioactive material, and research, medical and industrial uses of radionuclides. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Support Member States in the establishment of regulatory systems for the safe management of NORM;Develop new guidance on radiation protection and safety in existing exposure situations; Organize regional workshops on the regulatory control of existing exposure situations, radon and non-medical imaging, among others;Hold a Technical Meeting on Radiation Protection of Paediatric and Pregnant Patients; and Hold a Technical Meeting on Advisory Services for Radiation Protection and Safety for Medical Exposures.# B.2. Control of Radiation Sources# Trends40. The increased use of sealed radioactive sources in medicine, industry, agriculture and research has resulted in a need to ensure appropriate arrangements for the control of sources and the safe and secure management of disused sealed radioactive sources, including national strategies for managing disused radioactive sources and establishing national programmes and regulatory requirements.41. Member States continue to request further guidance on the application of paragraph 22(b) of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources on ensuring financial provisions for the safe management and secure protection of radioactive sources once they have become disused, as well as on regulatory requirements for the different options in the management of disused sources.42. In 2022, five additional Member States made a political commitment to implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, with the total number increasing to 145. Six Member States notified the Director General of their intention to act in a harmonized manner with the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources, meaning that the total number of Member States that have done so increased to 129. Four additional Member States nominated points of contact for facilitating the import and export of radioactive sources, bringing the total number of Member States that have done so to 149, and 8 Member States made a political commitment to implementing the supplementary Guidance on the Management of Disused Radioactive Sources, bringing the total that have done so to 52 (see Figure 4).![]( 4. Member State support for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and its supplementary guidance documents.# Related Activities43. The Agency will assist Member States in the management of radioactive sources from cradle to grave through guidance documents, peer reviews, advisory services, training courses and workshops. The Agency will also promote the effective application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources and Guidance on the Management of Disused Radioactive Sources, and facilitate the sharing of experience. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Organize regional workshops to raise awareness and share experiences of the reuse and recycling of radioactive sources, as one of the recommended options for the safe management of disused sealed radioactive sources;Hold a Technical Meeting with all States’ points of contact for the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources;Hold an Open-Ended Meeting of Technical and Legal Experts for Sharing Information on States’ Implementation of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, and recognize the 20th anniversary of the approval of the Code of Conduct by the Board of Governors; andDevelop guidance on ensuring financial provisions for the safe management and secureprotection of radioactive sources once they have become disused.# B.3. Safe Transport of Radioactive Material# Trends44. Denials and delays of international shipments of radioactive material continue to be a problem for Member States. A Denial of Shipment Working Group has been established for a four-year term for the period 2023–2026. The objective of this group is to analyse the issue and propose an effective and sustainable solution to this long-standing problem.45. Some Member States are increasingly interested in the construction and deployment of TNPPs and their transport (movement), as well as in the transport of nuclear fuel for SMRs. The applicability of Agency safety standards to these cases is an important concern for Member States.46. Member States continue to request support for the application of Agency safety standards to the classification, design assessment and approval of transport packages for fissile material. Many of these requests come from States embarking on new nuclear power programmes that wish to develop an understanding of the requirements for the transport of fissile material and for approval of appropriate transport packages, using the latest techniques for package design evaluation.# There is...·SupportfortheapplicationofAgencysafetystandardstotheclassification, designassessmentandapproval of transport packagesforfissilematerial.

Continue developing a publication related to design safety, operation safety and deployment and authorization of TNPPs, and, in coordination with the Agency SMRs platform and networks on SMRs and TNPPs, review the applicability of Agency safety standards to the transport of radioactive material associated with innovative reactor technologies;C Hold a workshop on the Transport Safety Regulatory Programme for Uranium and other Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material Produced by Mining and Milling; and Hold the School for Drafting Regulations on Transport Safety in English and French.# B.4. Decommissioning, Spent Fuel Management and Waste Management# Trends48. Demand for the ARTEMIS service continues and the Agency has been requested to organize 11 ARTEMIS missions in 2023 and 2024. In addition, some Member States have requested peer review of pre-operational safety of the deep geological disposal projects.49. As the worldwide nuclear industry ages, significant global growth in the number of nuclear decommissioning projects has increased the need for Member State capacity to develop a national framework, strategies and plans for decommissioning and for more flexible provisions in Member States for the release of material, waste and sites from regulatory control after the completion of decommissioning. Member States are looking for new guidance on planning, implementing and regulating the clearance process and the release of sites from regulatory control.International Project on Completion of Decommissioning (COMDEC)Yearstarted:2018·Definition of decommissioning end state;·Planningand implementationofactivitiesneededtoachieve theendstate;·Demonstrationofcompliancewiththe end state objectives;and·Definitionand implementation of institutional controlsin case of site release with restrictions.203 powerreactors fullydecommissioned permanently withsitesreleased from shudown regulatorycontrol40+partipans 30 Member States·Technical Meetings ·Sitevisitsand demonstrations ·Virtual meetings of working groups ·Drafting of project reports50. Member States continue to seek Agency assistance in developing and implementing safe interim and long term management solutions for radioactive waste, including the siting of radioactive waste management facilities. Disposal provides a safe and permanent long term management solution for waste. Assisting Member States in planning for and implementing national disposal programmes is an ongoing priority for the Agency. There is increasing interest in Member States in establishing sound practices for the management of radioactive waste from innovative reactors, including SMRs, that may be deployed in the future.51. Member States continue to request Agency guidance and advice on the development of the safety case and safety assessments with which to guide the implementation of near surface disposal of very low and low level radioactive waste.52. Several Member States are increasingly interested in geological disposal of high level radioactive waste and spent fuel when considered as waste. Research, site investigations, licensing and construction activities for geological disposal facilities are progressing in many Member States. In addition, some Member States are pursuing a closed nuclear fuel cycle and some consider spent fuel as a resource rather than waste. Further consideration is needed for strengthened safety in this regard.53. Member States continue to request assistance in the safe long term management of disused sealed radioactive sources, including in the development of safe and secure storage facilities and borehole disposal facilities.54. Member States have expressed a strong need for Agency support in establishing regulatory and safety infrastructure for the management of residues containing NORM or of areas contaminated with NORM residues.# GC(67)/INF/2Page 24![]( Agency support indevelopingand implementing plansfornear surfacedisposal ofvery lowandlow level radioactivewaste; ·Interest in geological disposal of high level radioactive wasteand spent fuel whenconsideredaswaste;and ·Increased numberofnucleardecommissioningprojects.# There is an ...# Need for...·Agencysupportinestablishing regulatoryand safetyinfrastructure forthe managementof residuescontaining NORM;·Guidance onapplication of clearance proceduresand on the derivationof specificclearance levels;andSupportfordevelopmentand implementationofnationalpoliciesand strategiesforsafetyatdecommissioning，managementof radioactivewaste andspentnuclearfuel.# Related Activities55. The Agency will assist Member States in developing and implementing national policies and strategies for the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, including disposal of waste, disused sealed radioactive sources, geological disposal of high level waste and spent fuel when considered as waste, and the development of decommissioning strategies and plans. The Agency is planning to undertake the following related activities:Continue activities related to the development and implementation of national policies and strategies for the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel;Continue activities of the International Harmonization and Safety Demonstration Project for Predisposal Radioactive Waste Management;Hold Technical Meetings under the International Project on Completion of Decommissioning; Continue activities to promote the new guidance on clearance and on the derivation of specific clearance levels for materials suitable for recycling or reuse, or for disposal in landfills; Hold Technical Meetings on decommissioning of medical, industrial and research facilities; Hold Technical Meetings related to the safety of decommissioning and disposal of radioactive material; andContinue implementing activities under the Regulatory Forum for Safety of Uranium Production and NORM to promote application of Agency safety standards and continue providing assistance to Member States upon request.# B.5. Radiation Protection of the Environment and Remediation# Trends56. International attention continues to be paid to the Agency’s review of the handling of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water at Fukushima Daiichi NPP and the associated plan to discharge the ALPS treated water into the sea. Member States have consistently highlighted the importance of the Agency’s independence and technical expertise in this process and have called for the Agency’s continued involvement and transparency.57. With continued concern regarding radiologically contaminated areas owing to past practices and the need for remediation of such areas for protection of human health and the environment, there is continued interest in identification and characterization of contaminated areas. Where remediation is justified and is planned to be implemented, Member States are seeking Agency support in establishing open communication with interested parties. Member States with remediation projects at their final stage are requesting support and guidance from the Agency on planning and implementing long term postremediation management, particularly where remediated sites cannot be released from regulatory control owing to the potential socioeconomic development of surrounding populated areas.58. Observations from Agency missions have shown that the use of a wide range of nuclear techniques and applications worldwide and activities such as uranium mining and milling and NORM industries have resulted in a growing need to analyse and evaluate the radiological implications of radionuclides being released to the environment.

Technical Support and Assistance to Ukraine# Trends114. On 24 February 2022, the Agency, through its Incident and Emergency Centre, was notified of the imposition of martial law on the territory of Ukraine and of an alert at Chornobyl NPP. From that date, the Agency closely monitored the situation at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities as well as activities involving radioactive sources, focusing on the implications for nuclear safety and security, and issued regular reports and public statements. The Agency issued two Summary Reports on Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine8 and provided two detailed reports to the Agency’s Board of Governors on the situation in Ukraine (GOV/2022/52 and GOV/2022/66).115. The situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (ZNPP) continues to be dangerous, precarious and challenging with the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict (‘Seven Pillars’) being compromised at the site at all times. This situation underscores the need to agree on arrangements to ensure that the plant is protected.116. Discussions aimed at agreeing on arrangements to ensure that the ZNPP is protected, with the ultimate aim of preventing a nuclear accident, were intensified; within the reporting period, efforts still needed to be made with regard to reaching an agreement and commitment by the concerned parties as soon as possible.117. The continued presence of Agency nuclear safety and security experts at the ZNPP has enabled progress in terms of gradually improving and deepening the understanding of the situation and related nuclear safety and security issues at the site. Ever since its establishment, the Agency team present at the site has been able to share observations and report on the nuclear safety and security situation in an impartial and independent manner, which proved essential during the reporting period.118. The operating staff at the ZNPP continued to show endurance and resilience in keeping the facility safe and secure amid the armed conflict. The difficulties for personnel at the ZNPP significantly intensified during the reporting period, with their crucial work having to be carried out under increasingly difficult conditions, with potentially severe consequences for nuclear safety and security and for their own well-being. The Director General repeatedly called for the concerned parties to put an end to the enormous pressure being placed on the Ukrainian operating staff.119. The Agency continued to provide technical support and assistance to Ukraine in nuclear safety and security. The Agency conducted nine in-person missions to Ukraine to help stabilize the situation, closely assess nuclear safety and security and assess corresponding needs. Seven deliveries of donated and procured equipment to various organizations were carried out during the reporting period. The Agency agreed with Ukrainian officials that a continuous Agency presence would also be established at Khmelnytskyy, Rivne, South Ukraine and Chornobyl NPPs.120. The continued commitment of Member States and close cooperation with the Agency are essential to ensure nuclear safety and security in Ukraine under all circumstances and to provide assistance efficiently.121. The Agency has begun an internal review of challenges in the application of Agency safety standards and nuclear security guidance in armed conflict situations. The review will cover nuclear safety and security considerations for all nuclear and radiation facilities and activities. It will analyse the issues and challenges faced at nuclear facilities in terms of the practical application of Agency safety standards and nuclear security guidance during armed conflicts, using the knowledge and experience gathered in Ukraine since February 2022, and how these issues and challenges might be addressed.# Related Activities# 122.
